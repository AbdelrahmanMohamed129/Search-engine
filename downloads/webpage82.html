Though Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/26\/twitter-will-free-up-handles-by-deleting-inactive-accounts\/\">for years has promised<\/a> to put more usernames back into rotation, it hadn&#8217;t yet made any large-scale effort to do so, despite having <a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/rules-and-policies\/inactive-twitter-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an inactive account policy<\/a> in place that suggests Twitter&#8217;s users should log in at least every 30 days to keep accounts from being permanently removed.<\/p>\n<p>According to Musk, Twitter&#8217;s purge is more conservative than that policy states. Instead, he says the company is purging accounts that have had &#8220;no activity at all for several years,&#8221; while also warning users that the result of the purge may mean users&#8217; follower counts drop. That&#8217;s something that may be more noticeable on longtime Twitter accounts whose owners accumulated a large following during Twitter&#8217;s early days as a social network.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re purging accounts that have had no activity at all for several years, so you will probably see follower count drop<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1655608985058267139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 8, 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>In a follow-up tweet, Musk also clarified in response to a question about username availability that &#8220;yes,&#8221; a lot of usernames were about to become available as a result of this move. He didn&#8217;t, however, clarify how users would be able to acquire these usernames beyond the usual method of trying to create a new account with a particular name.<\/p>\n<p>In recent months, Twitter had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/11\/twitter-selling-usernames-via-online-auctions\/\">considered selling desired usernames through online auctions<\/a> to generate additional revenue. It&#8217;s not clear if that plan still remains in play or how it will work, if so. In December 2022, Musk had also tweeted that Twitter would &#8220;soon&#8221; start freeing the namespace of 1.5 billion accounts, noting that inactive accounts would be deleted as part of that process.<\/p>\n<p>Musk has been interested in freeing up usernames for some time, having also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1587252368999153665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted<\/a> in October it was something he was keen to do as Twitter&#8217;s new owner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Since Musk&#8217;s takeover of the social network, Twitter has faced increased competition from Twitter alternatives, including open source platform <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/08\/what-is-mastodon\/\">Mastodon<\/a>, decentralized rival <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/05\/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-app-trying-to-replace-twitter\/\">Bluesky<\/a> and other Twitter clones like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/25\/t2-twitter-alternative-expansion-invites\/\">T2<\/a>, nostr and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/03\/post-a-twitter-alternative-that-pays-publishers-via-microtransactions-launches-public-beta\/\">Post<\/a>, among others. Though none on its own has become the &#8220;new Twitter,&#8221; each network has managed to siphon off thousands of Twitter users, with Mastodon now touting 1.2 million monthly active users across its servers, for example. Other companies, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/05\/substacks-new-short-form-notes-feed-looks-a-lot-like-twitter\/\">Substack<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/13\/magazine-app-flipboard-adds-support-for-original-content-and-conversation-with-new-notes-feature\/\">Flipboard<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/11\/artifact-the-news-aggregator-from-instagrams-co-founders-adds-a-social-discussions-feature\/\">Artifact<\/a>, have also launched their own discussion features which could indirectly compete with Twitter as well.<\/p>\n<p>By opening up coveted usernames, Musk could potentially lure lapsed users back to Twitter, which in turn would benefit the network effects and ultimately, Twitter&#8217;s ability to generate revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Musk tweets a lot of things, and not all come to pass in the time frame he suggests. So far, neither the official Twitter account nor the Twitter Support account has shared any updates related to the potential username land grab or other details about this process. In Musk&#8217;s replies, many people are asking if there will be a way to memorialize the accounts of those who have passed, rather than deleting them. This hasn&#8217;t been addressed yet, either.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is purging inactive accounts on its platform, which may free up a number of long-coveted usernames, according to recent tweets by owner Elon Musk.

First, as any reporter can tell you, writing a profile piece that does not feature at least some puffery is not easy, and profiling someone like Holmes has to be more complicated than most. She hasn&#8217;t talked to the media since 2016, and she is a highly persuasive character who managed to make many powerful people bend to her will.<\/p>\n<p>As former Theranos employee and whistleblower Tyler Shultz<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/video\/tyler-shultz-reacts-to-elizabeth-holmes-verdict\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> told CBS News<\/a> early last year of Holmes, &#8220;Elizabeth is a very, very charismatic person. When she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While Chozick might have written a heavier-handed story &#8212; one that people who reflexively read the story might have preferred &#8212; the brilliance of this piece is that she takes the opposite approach. She lets Holmes perform her magic but offers a peek behind the curtain as Holmes does it.<\/p>\n<p>Holmes pulls a lot out of her hat. Chozick spends time with not only Holmes, her romantic partner, Billy Evans, and their two children, but also Holmes&#8217;s parents and others in Holmes&#8217;s orbit. Holmes and Evans take Chozick to the beach with their dog, Teddy. They invite her to join them for Mexican food at their quaint rental home on the Pacific coast. They visit the San Diego Zoo together and, in a separate meeting, have croissants and berries and coffee made by Evans. Chozick doesn&#8217;t need to mention each of these outings discretely, but by doing so, she let us witness Holmes&#8217;s subtle charm campaign as if we were there with her.<\/p>\n<p>Holmes &#8212; whose prison sentence was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/26\/theranos-founder-elizabeth-holmes-isnt-headed-to-jail-tomorrow-after-all\/\">recently delayed<\/a> &#8212; grows so confident in Chozick&#8217;s presence that she even imagines inventing another Theranos. \u201cI still dream about being able to contribute in that space,\u201d Holmes tells her. \u201cI still feel the same calling to it as I always did and I still think the need is there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The campaign almost works. &#8220;I realized that I was essentially writing a story about two different people,\u201d Chozick writes. \u201dThere was Elizabeth, celebrated in the media as a rock-star inventor whose brilliance dazzled illustrious rich men, and whose criminal trial captivated the world. Then there is &#8216;Liz,&#8217; (as Mr. Evans and her friends call her), the mom of two who, for the past year, has been volunteering for a rape crisis hotline. Who can\u2019t stomach R-rated movies and who rushed after me one afternoon with a paper towel to wipe a mix of sand and her dog\u2019s slobber off my shoe.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The writer is so dazzled by &#8220;Liz&#8221; and finds her so &#8220;normal&#8221; that her editors have to snap her out of her trance, after which she begins to see the picture more clearly.<\/p>\n<p>Writes Chozick, &#8220;I was admittedly swept up in Liz as an authentic and sympathetic person. She\u2019s gentle and charismatic, in a quiet way. My editor laughed at me when I shared these impressions, telling me (and I quote), &#8216;Amy Chozick, you got rolled!'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Initially, she doubts her editor, saying she is certain she has come to know Holmes in a way that might surprise readers. But then, she adds, &#8220;something very strange happened. I worked my way through a list of Ms. Holmes\u2019s friends, family and longtime supporters, whom she and Mr. Evans suggested I speak to. One of these friends said Ms. Holmes had genuine intentions at Theranos and didn\u2019t deserve a lengthy prison sentence. Then, this person requested anonymity to caution me not to believe everything Ms. Holmes says.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>At another point, Chozick is again understated about seeing behind the artifice, writing, &#8220;Ms. Holmes\u2019s story of how she got here \u2014 to the bright, cozy house and the supportive partner and the two babies \u2014 feels a lot like the story of someone who had finally broken out of a cult and been deprogrammed. After her relationship with Mr. Balwani ended and Theranos dissolved, Ms. Holmes said, &#8216;I began my life again.&#8217; But then I remember that Ms. Holmes was running the cult.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>As the story ends, Chozick deliberately marvels at how much more time Holmes and Evans want to spend with her, inviting her to join them and their friends for yet another dinner, asking if she would like to come back for another date to the zoo with her own family. &#8220;I appreciated their hospitality,&#8221; she writes, &#8220;but I didn\u2019t fully understand it. Usually interview subjects can\u2019t wait to get rid of me.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Then Chozick realizes why they &#8220;keep opening the door wider.&#8221; If &#8220;you are in her presence, it is impossible not to believe her, not to be taken with her and be taken in by her.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The observation brings to mind something else Shultz said about his time at Theranos in that interview with CBS News last year. &#8220;Even when I was working with the product every single day, seeing it fail time after time after time,&#8221; he&#8217;d said, &#8220;I could go and have a five-minute conversation with Elizabeth and feel like I was saving the world again.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Critics are flaming The New York Times for posting earlier this morning what they say is an overly empathetic 5,500-word profile of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.

If a certain number of consecutive measurements are irregular, the smartwatch will warn its user of potential AFib activity, prompting them to take an ECG using their watch for a more accurate measurement.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2539202\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2539202\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2539202\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png\" alt=\"An image depicting Samsung's irregular heart rhythm feature on a galaxy watch\" width=\"1024\" height=\"560\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png 2212w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=300,164 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=768,420 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=680,372 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=1536,840 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=2048,1120 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=1200,656 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-08-at-10.41.16-AM.png?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2539202\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Samsung<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification feature will be available as part of the newly announced\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/news.samsung.com\/us\/better-sleep-health-new-one-ui-5-first-look-upcoming-samsung-galaxy-watch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-describedby=\"audioeye_new_window_message\">One UI 5 Watch<\/a>, coming first to the upcoming Galaxy Watch devices later this year, and later expanding to previous editions.

Musk says Twitter is purging old accounts, freeing up desired usernames"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Twitter is purging inactive accounts on its platform, which may free up a number of long-coveted usernames, according to recent tweets by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/08\/elon-musks-twitter-everything-you-need-to-know-from-layoffs-to-verification\/\">owner Elon Musk<\/a>. Though Twitter <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/11\/26\/twitter-will-free-up-handles-by-deleting-inactive-accounts\/\">for years has promised<\/a> to put more usernames back into rotation, it hadn&#8217;t yet made any large-scale effort to do so, despite having <a href=\"https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/rules-and-policies\/inactive-twitter-accounts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an inactive account policy<\/a> in place that suggests Twitter&#8217;s users should log in at least every 30 days to keep accounts from being permanently removed.<\/p>\n<p>According to Musk, Twitter&#8217;s purge is more conservative than that policy states. Instead, he says the company is purging accounts that have had &#8220;no activity at all for several years,&#8221; while also warning users that the result of the purge may mean users&#8217; follower counts drop. That&#8217;s something that may be more noticeable on longtime Twitter accounts whose owners accumulated a large following during Twitter&#8217;s early days as a social network.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We\u2019re purging accounts that have had no activity at all for several years, so you will probably see follower count drop<\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1655608985058267139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">May 8, 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>In a follow-up tweet, Musk also clarified in response to a question about username availability that &#8220;yes,&#8221; a lot of usernames were about to become available as a result of this move. He didn&#8217;t, however, clarify how users would be able to acquire these usernames beyond the usual method of trying to create a new account with a particular name.<\/p>\n<p>In recent months, Twitter had <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/11\/twitter-selling-usernames-via-online-auctions\/\">considered selling desired usernames through online auctions<\/a> to generate additional revenue. It&#8217;s not clear if that plan still remains in play or how it will work, if so. In December 2022, Musk had also tweeted that Twitter would &#8220;soon&#8221; start freeing the namespace of 1.5 billion accounts, noting that inactive accounts would be deleted as part of that process.<\/p>\n<p>Musk has been interested in freeing up usernames for some time, having also <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1587252368999153665\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted<\/a> in October it was something he was keen to do as Twitter&#8217;s new owner.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Since Musk&#8217;s takeover of the social network, Twitter has faced increased competition from Twitter alternatives, including open source platform <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/08\/what-is-mastodon\/\">Mastodon<\/a>, decentralized rival <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/05\/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-app-trying-to-replace-twitter\/\">Bluesky<\/a> and other Twitter clones like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/25\/t2-twitter-alternative-expansion-invites\/\">T2<\/a>, nostr and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/03\/post-a-twitter-alternative-that-pays-publishers-via-microtransactions-launches-public-beta\/\">Post<\/a>, among others. Though none on its own has become the &#8220;new Twitter,&#8221; each network has managed to siphon off thousands of Twitter users, with Mastodon now touting 1.2 million monthly active users across its servers, for example. Other companies, like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/05\/substacks-new-short-form-notes-feed-looks-a-lot-like-twitter\/\">Substack<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/13\/magazine-app-flipboard-adds-support-for-original-content-and-conversation-with-new-notes-feature\/\">Flipboard<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/11\/artifact-the-news-aggregator-from-instagrams-co-founders-adds-a-social-discussions-feature\/\">Artifact<\/a>, have also launched their own discussion features which could indirectly compete with Twitter as well.<\/p>\n<p>By opening up coveted usernames, Musk could potentially lure lapsed users back to Twitter, which in turn would benefit the network effects and ultimately, Twitter&#8217;s ability to generate revenue.<\/p>\n<p>Still, Musk tweets a lot of things, and not all come to pass in the time frame he suggests. So far, neither the official Twitter account nor the Twitter Support account has shared any updates related to the potential username land grab or other details about this process. In Musk&#8217;s replies, many people are asking if there will be a way to memorialize the accounts of those who have passed, rather than deleting them. This hasn&#8217;t been addressed yet, either.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is purging inactive accounts on its platform, which may free up a number of long-coveted usernames, according to recent tweets by owner Elon Musk.

That&#8217;s turned Bluesky invites into hot commodities, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/bluesky-invites-become-a-hot-commodity-as-demand-for-the-twitter-alternative-outstrips-access\/\">where they&#8217;re even selling for hundreds of dollars on eBay<\/a>, as most users have to wait to receive only one invite every two weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Bluesky leadership will also sometimes gift a user with a larger number of invites in order to have them invite members of a specific community. Developers who can demonstrate they&#8217;re building a Bluesky app may also request additional invites, we understand.<\/p>\n<p>The network has received outsized press coverage relative to its size &#8212; just 50,000+ users &#8212; possibly because of the heavy infusion of tech journalists on there and Dorsey&#8217;s name attached. But the reality is that Bluesky&#8217;s future remains uncertain. The company, for now, is able to build and grow thanks to the $13 million in initial funds it received from Twitter, where it was incubated under Dorsey&#8217;s leadership. It has since spun out into its own, independent company (a public benefit LLC). It&#8217;s unclear how Bluesky intends to maintain its operations in the long term, not to mention its freewheeling culture and accepting community. Networks can often be pleasant and welcoming when small, like Bluesky &#8212; or early Twitter, for that matter &#8212; but face challenges once they scale to millions of users.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PRwAi75HFo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/bluesky-invites-become-a-hot-commodity-as-demand-for-the-twitter-alternative-outstrips-access\/\">Bluesky invites become a hot commodity as demand for the Twitter alternative outstrips access<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Bluesky invites become a hot commodity as demand for the Twitter alternative outstrips access&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/bluesky-invites-become-a-hot-commodity-as-demand-for-the-twitter-alternative-outstrips-access\/embed\/#?secret=BUTXv8nmQ8#?secret=PRwAi75HFo\" data-secret=\"PRwAi75HFo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>NewFronts round-up<\/h3>\n<p>This week was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iab.com\/events\/newfronts-2023\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IAB&#8217;s NewFronts<\/a>, where digital media companies and social networks pitched their platforms to advertisers looking to reach online audiences.

pitches augmented reality to advertisers with new AR Reels Ads and Facebook Stories"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Augmented reality is coming to Reels Ads and Facebook Stories, Meta announced this afternoon at the IAB&#8217;s NewFronts as part of its pitch to advertisers. The update allows brands like Sephora, Tiffany &amp; Co. and others to offer more immersive experiences and AR filters when marketing to Meta&#8217;s audience, including its younger Gen Z users. The company said it&#8217;s also rolling out other enhancements and improvements to Reels ads and noted brands will now be able to work with third-party measurement partners for their Reels Ads campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Meta&#8217;s investment in augmented reality (AR) advertising could better position the company to compete with Snap for marketers&#8217; ad dollars, as they look for ways to reach the younger, Gen Z demographic. Earlier this week at NewFronts, Snap introduced its own set of new ad products, including those for Stories and its TikTik clone known as Spotlight. But its more eye-catching news was its test of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/snap-announces-tests-of-sponsored-links-in-my-ai-new-ad-products-for-spotlight-and-stories\/\">sponsored links in its AI chatbot feature, My AI. <\/a><\/p>\n<p>In terms of AR, however, Snap has long offered ways for brands to reach its users through the format, including through a variety of AR commerce features and its popular Snapchat Lenses, for example. It also works with brands that want to leverage its AR technology on their own websites and apps <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/19\/snapchats-ar-technology-comes-to-the-real-world-with-ar-mirrors\/\">through its AR Enterprise Services division<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Before today&#8217;s announcement, Meta offered AR ads in the Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed and Instagram Stories. According to its data, these ads drove incremental ad recall with the 18- to 24-year-old demographic 87% of the time, outperforming non-AR-enabled ads.<\/p>\n<p>Now, those ads can run in other prominent places across Meta&#8217;s platform, including Facebook and Instagram Reels and Facebook Stories.<\/p>\n<p>Sephora was able to test AR Reels ads ahead of this launch, where it ran an ad that had users press their thumb to the screen to generate an &#8220;aura vibe&#8221; filter to help them pick the best-fitting fragrance and make a purchase. The company said over half of the ad&#8217;s audience was Gen Z users.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2538037\" style=\"width: 358px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2538037\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2538037 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?w=348\" alt=\"\" width=\"348\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg 922w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=77,150 77w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=154,300 154w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=768,1499 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=348,680 348w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=787,1536 787w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=615,1200 615w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-04-at-12.32.21-PM.jpg?resize=26,50 26w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2538037\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Meta<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Tiffany &amp; Co. also created an AR ad that let users immerse themselves in their 5th Avenue flagship store, &#8220;The Landmark,&#8221; and browse the jewelry.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to the expansion of AR advertising, Meta announced features to make Reels Ads more interactive, including a test of a larger &#8220;call to action&#8221; button with additional advertiser information on Facebook and Instagram Reels ads.

The company said these firms are helping it to test and launch a Reels Viewability reporting option that will later roll out to advertisers when testing is complete.<\/p>\n<p>The company also took a moment during its presentation to pitch its investments in AI, noting it&#8217;s using the technology is being used to improve ads ranking by learning which ads are working and which are not, and to better predict which ads are going to be most relevant.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s also driving efficiency for a suite of ad products, eliminating many of the manual and tedious steps of creating an ad,&#8221; said Nicola Mendelsohn, Meta&#8217;s head of Global Business Group. She added that Meta&#8217;s investments were &#8220;already paying off, especially with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/733979527611858\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Advantage<\/a>, which is our brand name for our portfolio of AI products. Meta Advantage leverages machine learning and AI to help advertisers test and learn but to also realize their campaigns fast and help them acquire and grow their customer base.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Mendelsohn said the majority of Meta advertisers were already using an AI product, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/1362234537597370\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Advantage+ Shopping,<\/a> launched only last August. Before, advertisers had to manually set up a campaign to text their mix of targeting, creative and placement, she explained, which was time-consuming. Now, advertisers can use Advantage+ Shopping campaigns to executive million of iterations of targeting performance scenarios within milliseconds, allowing them to pick the best combination, in order to send the best ad to the right person at the right time &#8212; all thanks to AI.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is just the start of how AI can create better connections with people and drive more growth for your business. And we&#8217;re going to have more and more product updates and announcements around AI just in the coming few weeks,&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>The company had also spoken about its AI agenda during its Q1 earnings, noting also how AI was improving its Reels monetization efficiency, which was up over 30% on Instagram and over 40% on Facebook on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

The Uber integration could push Alexa device owners to try something new, as it would see Uber marketing the order-tracking feature in its own app, helping drive adoption.<\/p>\n<p>When the update goes live, users will be able to turn on a new &#8220;Track with Alexa&#8221; option in the Uber Eats app&#8217;s Voice Assistant settings. Then, after checking out with their food order, they can tap a new Alexa button to start tracking the order&#8217;s progress.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2538110\" style=\"width: 437px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2538110\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2538110\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"427\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg 1074w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg?resize=150,114 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg?resize=300,228 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg?resize=768,584 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg?resize=680,517 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Uber_Eats_x_Alexa.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2538110\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Uber Eats \/ Alexa<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>There are a couple of ways Echo owners can receive the order-tracking updates. They can choose the more traditional notification method, which changes the Echo&#8217;s blue ring light to yellow, and customers can respond by saying, &#8220;Alexa, what&#8217;s my notification?&#8221; This is similar to how Alexa users may check in on their Amazon delivery updates, for example.<\/p>\n<p>The other option would allow Alexa to actually announce when there&#8217;s a status change to the order to either one or all the household Echo devices. This way, the Uber Eats customer doesn&#8217;t have to keep checking their phone to see where their order is, as Alexa will announce when the food is ready, when it&#8217;s picked up for delivery, and when the driver has arrived at their house.<\/p>\n<p>Alexa will also announce when something changes with the order, like if it was canceled for some reason.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Uber worked closely with Amazon on how the feature should work. It decided to make the feature something the user has to enable on each order, rather than something they turn on at the account level. The latter, the company believed, could have risky downsides.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, imagine a customer who has placed an order for a sandwich, but forgot they had turned on hands-free notifications with Alexa. And now imagine that they had a sleeping baby at home,&#8221; explained Uber Eats lead product manager Ethan Hollinshead, <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.amazon.com\/en-US\/blogs\/alexa\/alexa-skills-kit\/2023\/05\/uber-eats-may-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in a blog post<\/a>. &#8220;Or imagine a scenario where someone places an order while traveling, only to have Alexa provide notifications to everyone back home.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The new experience instead combines the convenience of having Alexa alert you to updates on an opt-in basis, but without the troubling downsides of an always-on integration. You can choose on each order whether you want Alexa&#8217;s alerts.<\/p>\n<p>The feature, which joins Uber&#8217;s other integrations with Google Assistant and Siri, is now rolling out to Uber Eats&#8217; U.S. customers.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated, 5\/5\/23, 9:30 AM ET to note the functionality is now live.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wondering where your Uber Eats order is?

expands its Mastodon investment with beta launch of its own highly moderated server"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Mozilla is expanding its investment in the decentralized social media ecosystem Mastodon with today&#8217;s announcement it&#8217;s opening its own server &#8212; or &#8220;instance,&#8221; in Mastodon lingo &#8212; into private beta testing. The company <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/en\/mozilla\/mozilla-launch-fediverse-instance-social-media-alternative\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced last year<\/a> its plans to create and begin testing a publicly accessible instance at <a href=\"https:\/\/mozilla.social\/explore\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mozilla.social,<\/a> with the goal of focusing on how it could help solve the &#8220;technical, experience and trustworthiness&#8221; challenges in a federated social space. Now, it says, it&#8217;s ready to begin onboarding users from its waitlist.<\/p>\n<p>The company clarified that its approach to the social network will not be one that&#8217;s fully permissive of free speech. Instead, Mozilla says that declaring a platform &#8220;neutral&#8221;\u00a0 is often used as an excuse to allow behaviors and content that are designed to harass and harm others. This puts its approach to content moderation in seeming opposition to others including, most notably, Elon Musk&#8217;s vision for Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our content moderation plan is rooted in the goals and values expressed in our Mozilla Manifesto \u2014 human dignity, inclusion, security, individual expression and collaboration,&#8221; an <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mozilla.org\/en\/mozilla\/mozilla-social-mastodon-private-beta-announcement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announcement<\/a> published to Mozilla&#8217;s blog states. &#8220;We understand that individual expression is often seen, particularly in the U.S., as an absolute right to free speech at any cost. Even if that cost is harm to others. We do not subscribe to this view. We want to be clear about this,&#8221; it reads.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Mozilla notes that its new sandbox will come with rules about how its users are allowed to engage with one another. It stresses that those rules may not be perfect from day one, but the project will include engaging with the community in an open dialogue as things evolve.<\/p>\n<p>Mozilla says anyone who doesn&#8217;t also share its views on content moderation and limitations on free speech is &#8220;completely free to go elsewhere if you don\u2019t like them.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The instance isn&#8217;t yet broadly open to the public during this beta test. Interested users will have to first sign up for the <a href=\"https:\/\/prod.oidc-proxy.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net\/waitlist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">waitlist<\/a>, where they can optionally also share their existing Twitter or Mastodon handles. Currently, the instance has just 138 active users, its page shows. In total, the server now has 250 users.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re told Mozilla intends to keep the number intentionally small for the time being and is prioritizing the groups it&#8217;s reaching out to. Marginalized communities, publishers and journalists will be given priority.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;The communities we\u2019ve worked with previously will have first access to the Private beta, some of which will include folks from the waitlist,&#8221; notes Ted Han, Director of Product for Mozilla.social. He said the beta will be limited to around 1,000 users.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are planning to open the beta in phases because we want to ensure that we have a content moderation team and other tools that can be scaled relative to the size of the user base,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We\u2019re working towards opening the Mozilla.social beta this summer, but we\u2019re not in a rush as we think it\u2019s important to be deliberate about launching social media tools,&#8221; Han said.<\/p>\n<p>The instance isn&#8217;t the only way that Mozilla has invested in the Mastodon community. It also led the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/28\/mozilla-leads-mastodon-app-mammoths-pre-seed-funding\/\">pre-seed funding round for a Mastodon mobile app, known as Mammoth<\/a> earlier this year. Initially developed by iOS developer Shihab Mehboob, the creator of a whimsical music app Vinyls and the Twitter client Aviary 2, Mammoth was acquired by the company now leading the project. The new Mammoth is headed by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bartdecrem\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bart Decrem<\/a>, who previously ran marketing and business affairs at Mozilla Foundation and worked on the Firefox 1.0 launch and later found himself at Disney&#8217;s mobile game group, by way of the Tapulous <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2010\/07\/01\/tapulous-acquired-by-disney\/\">acquisition<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>One of Mammoth&#8217;s differentiating features is that it aims to make joining Mastodon easier by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/27\/mammoth-is-a-free-mastodon-app-for-ios-that-makes-it-easier-to-get-started\/\">adding users to a default server<\/a>, moth.social. It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if Mozilla&#8217;s own server was later given a more prominent position in the app, however. But for now, Mozilla said it&#8217;s not working directly with Mammoth on any such integrations.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mozilla is expanding its investment in the decentralized social media ecosystem Mastodon with today&#8217;s announcement it&#8217;s opening its own server &#8212; or &#8220;instance,&#8221; in Mastodon lingo &#8212; into private beta testing.

At this week&#8217;s NewFronts, the video entertainment company announced a new premium ad product that would allow marketers, for the first time, to position their brand ads directly after TikTok&#8217;s publisher and media partners&#8217; content in over a dozen categories, including lifestyle, sports, entertainment, education and more.<\/p>\n<p>The ad slot, dubbed &#8220;Pulse Premiere,&#8221; offers a sort of brand-safe space within TikTok&#8217;s social video network, as they&#8217;re guaranteed their ads will run immediately after what TikTok refers to as &#8220;suitable TikToks&#8221; from premium publishers.<\/p>\n<p>The move could address potential concerns over ad placement amid user-generated content that, in years past, has caused disruptions to YouTube&#8217;s ad revenue, as bands have had to freeze ads due to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/06\/01\/youtube-bans-hateful-videos-from-making-money-via-its-advertising-network\/\">offensive<\/a> and obscene material ranging from hate speech to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/27\/youtube-faces-brand-freeze-over-ads-and-obscene-comments-on-videos-of-kids\/\">child safety issues, <\/a>and more.<\/p>\n<p>With TikTok&#8217;s new offering, marketers can be assured of their placement as the content will run only alongside trusted publishers. In addition to NBCU, Cond\u00e9 Nast, DotDash Meredith and BuzzFeed, the company is also partnering with Hearst Magazines, Major League Soccer, UFC, Vox Media and WWE on the new program.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, marketers will be able to use TikTok&#8217;s ad platform to tie their campaigns to tentpole events through Pulse Premiere, the company says. Meanwhile, for publishers, the new ad slots will help them generate increased revenue from their TikTok investments by way of a revenue-sharing agreement.<\/p>\n<p>TikTok declined to share how much the new Pulse Premiere ad placements will cost, saying only that they are &#8220;premium ad placements.&#8221; It also didn&#8217;t detail the revenue share for participating publishers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At Cond\u00e9 Nast the power of our brands allows us to create culture-defining content for 1B of the most engaged audiences across many relevant platforms,&#8221; said Pam Drucker Mann, global chief revenue officer &amp; president, U.S. Revenue &amp; APAC at Cond\u00e9 Nast, in a statement. &#8220;TikTok has become one of our most valuable partners, providing us with a variety of tools to ensure that our brands are driving these conversations on their platform. Our advertisers know that culture is the new KPI, and the Pulse Premiere solution finally enables clients to match media buying with how consumers are consuming our brands, like Vogue, GQ and Vanity Fair, on TikTok,&#8221; she added.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Pulse Premiere is built off TikTok&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/04\/tiktok-introduces-its-first-ad-product-to-offer-a-revenue-share-with-creators\/\">initial Pulse offering launched last year,<\/a> which allowed marketers to place their ads next to the top 4% of content on the platform. The program was the first ad product to offer a revenue share with content creators, TikTok noted at the time. The company says its data indicates TikTok users are 2.6x more likely to interact with a Pulse ad versus a comparable ad on another video platform. It also notes that Pulse campaigns increased brand recall by +9.8%, on average, and awareness by +6.8%.<\/p>\n<p>However, in follow-up reports by <a href=\"https:\/\/fortune.com\/2023\/01\/23\/creators-report-extremely-low-earnings-from-tiktoks-ad-revenue-sharing-initiative\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fortune<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/tiktok-pulse-ad-revenue-share-payments-creators-2022-11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Insider<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.socialmediatoday.com\/news\/TikTok-Pulse-Providing-Low-Payouts-to-Creators\/641108\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">others<\/a>, creators reported extremely low earnings from Pulse &#8212; seeing revenue not even exceeding $5, in some cases. Among those creators interviewed by Insider, the revenue per every 1,000 video view on Pulse, or RPM, was in the range of just $6 to $8. One likened it to nothing more than a small bonus for having a video go viral, but it&#8217;s clear creators are not meant to rely on the ad rev share to fuel their businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, TikTok offers other monetization tools for creators like livestream gifting, subscriptions and a creator fund &#8212; though the latter has also been charged with paying out low amounts.

appeals ruling<\/a>, though largely in favor of Apple, may result in App Store fee relief for developers. Speaking to investors during <a href=\"https:\/\/ir.mtch.com\/news-and-events\/press-releases\/press-release-details\/2023\/Match-Group-Reports-First-Quarter-2023-Results\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Match&#8217;s Q1 earnings<\/a> call, Match Group President and CFO Gary Swidler shared the company&#8217;s thinking on the historic ruling, which upheld the lower court&#8217;s opinion that Apple was not a monopolist, but directed the iPhone maker to give developers the ability to place links in their apps that point customers to third-party payment options.<\/p>\n<p>This change to Apple&#8217;s existing &#8220;anti-steering&#8221; policy, which had prohibited developers from marketing other ways to pay, was the main reason <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/10\/11\/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold\/\">Apple had appealed<\/a> the district court&#8217;s earlier ruling. Despite losing its larger antitrust appeal, Epic Games <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TimSweeneyEpic\/status\/1650592345111273484?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1650592345111273484%7Ctwgr%5E33ebf33741d8684113d4f8302b2c44c067cbcbef%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F24%2Fapple-wins-antitrust-court-battle-with-epic-games-appeals-court-rules%2F\">immediately<\/a> seized on this part of the appeals court decision to announce it was &#8220;working on next steps&#8221; to take advantage of the loosened permissions.<\/p>\n<p>Match, meanwhile, didn&#8217;t offer a hint as to its own plans related to the ruling, but rather spoke more broadly about the potential changes coming to the larger app market as a result of this decision as well as other new laws and global regulations.<\/p>\n<p>For example, Swidler pointed investors to various battles Apple has been facing, including the recent antitrust investigation in the U.K. with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) focused on browsers and cloud gaming. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/03\/apple-cma-mir\/\">Apple won that appeal<\/a>, as well, but it&#8217;s representative of a market where Apple&#8217;s policy decisions will no longer go unchecked.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Match said the E.U.&#8217;s Digital Markets Act (DMA), whose <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/dma-applies\/\">new rules have now started to apply,<\/a> will have an impact on App Store fees.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In the E.U., and in some other jurisdictions like India, we think there&#8217;s going to be changes that are going to result in App Store fee changes&#8230; particularly as a result of the DMA in Europe &#8212; or in the E.U. &#8212; in 2024,&#8221; Swidler told investors.<\/p>\n<p>The exec said it wasn&#8217;t yet clear if the Apple-Epic ruling would result in App Store fee relief, but suggested it was &#8220;very possible,&#8221; adding that, ultimately, Apple has to decide if it wants to rethink its policies on a global basis or continue to set specific rules for each region.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;When you&#8230;factor all this in &#8212; with all these different changes and things going on and all these different jurisdictions &#8212; I think what it means is the app stores have to ask themselves a question, which is, are they going to respond to these changes in a piecemeal basis and have different policies and fee structures and approaches in different markets? Or are they going to have one global policy that addresses all of these really significant and valid concerns, and change app store policies to reflect a more fair app store ecosystem for consumers?,&#8221; Swidler said.<\/p>\n<p>Match said it expects to see some sort of decision related to those questions over the next 12 months or so.<\/p>\n<p>The dating app maker and Tinder parent has been heavily involved in pursuing antitrust actions against the app stores, including both Apple and Google, having already provided <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2021-04-19\/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">testimony at Senate antitrust hearings<\/a>, and engaging in other lawsuits, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/19\/epic-and-matchs-antitrust-case-against-google-heads-to-jury-trial-on-november-6\/\">one over Google&#8217;s Play Store fees<\/a>. It&#8217;s also among the tech companies aiding the Justice Department&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/29\/justice-department-in-early-stages-of-filing-an-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple-says-report\/\">antitrust investigation<\/a> against Apple, along with Tile, Spotify and others.<\/p>\n<p>In the quarter, Match suffered an earnings miss with revenue of $787 million coming under estimates of $794 million, and paying users down 3% to 15.9 million.

touts its new ad products, including an AI that matches campaigns to TV moments"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">In Roku&#8217;s recent quarter, the company posted <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/26\/roku-gains-1-6-million-active-streaming-accounts-in-q1-warns-of-continued-ad-uncertainty\/\">better-than-expected revenue of $741 million<\/a>, but worried investors with its warning of an uncertain ad market and declining average revenue per user. Today, at the IAB NewFronts, the streaming media company introduced its latest ad products to potentially help it address the latter, at least. These included new opportunities to advertise on Roku&#8217;s Home Screen, within its original content, and even in its screensaver, among other things. It also hyped its use of contextual AI for automatically running ads right next to the most relevant moments in shows and movies on The Roku Channel.<\/p>\n<p>The company explained that its new artificial intelligence capability searches across the Roku library for &#8220;iconic plot moments&#8221; that would match a brand&#8217;s message and place their ads in real time. To work, marketers will first tell Roku their campaign&#8217;s theme. The AI searches the library to match the campaign with key moments. For example, when Tim Gunn says &#8220;make it work&#8221; in &#8220;Project Runway,&#8221; an apparel brand could insert its message.<\/p>\n<p>Roku also announced a new slate of Roku Originals, which will include an entrepreneurship docuseries, &#8220;Side Hustlers,&#8221; produced by Hello Sunshine &#8212; Reese Witherspoon\u2019s media company that sold in 2021 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/02\/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-sold-to-new-media-firm-from-former-disney-execs\/\">for $900 million to Candle Media<\/a>, the company run by former Disney execs Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, which now has its hand in numerous pies across the streaming landscape. Digital bank Ally was also involved in this production that focuses on people turning their side hustle into their main business.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2536956\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2536956\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2536956\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"337\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg 2744w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=768,381 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=680,337 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=1536,761 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1015 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=1200,595 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-5.39.40-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2536956\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Roku<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Other new Originals arriving this year include \u201cCelebrity Family Cook Off,\u201d a series executive produced by Sofia Vergara and hosted by Manolo Gonzalez Vergara and \u201cCarpe DM with Juanpa,\u201d which will feature social media star Juanpa Zurita, among others.\u00a0 Roku said it&#8217;s also renewing \u201cThe Great American Baking Show,\u201d featuring Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Ellie Kemper and Zach Cherry and \u201cHonest Renovations,\u201d featuring Jessica Alba and Lizzy Mathis.<\/p>\n<p>The company claimed its Originals were\u00a0<span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">delivering<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">better<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">than<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">cable,<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">and<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">even<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">better<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">than<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">broadcast<\/span> <span class=\"transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted\" data-highlighted=\"false\" data-playhead=\"false\">audiences every day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The streaming company additionally used its time to pitch marketers about how to reach its now 71.6 million active accounts on its service via new ad products and placements.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The pitch, delivered by <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2023\/tv\/news\/roku-charlie-collier-newfronts-advertising-tv-1235599442\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Roku Media President<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/charlie-collier-30073771\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charlie Collier<\/a>, touted Roku&#8217;s reach in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Americans spend more time on Roku than any other TV platform, which means they spend more time here with Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ and even more time streaming CBS, NBC ABC, and Fox,&#8221;

The screensaver is used by nearly 40 million homes, Roku said.<\/p>\n<p>The company also introduced new discovery experiences that allow brands to host content in areas like Home &amp; Garden and Sports experiences that curate content from across TV on the Roku Home Screen.

That&#8217;s helped the app reach No. 22 among social apps by Google Play downloads on April 26 and up to the No. 11 spot among social apps by iOS downloads on April 24.<\/p>\n<p>Because of its relative newness, data.ai said it&#8217;s not yet able to accurately predict the number of daily or monthly active users at this time.<\/p>\n<p>The rankings are impressive not just because the app is still fresh out of the gate, but because its community is still quite small.<\/p>\n<p>As of a few days ago, Bluesky <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/27\/blueskys-best-shot-at-success-is-to-embrace-shitposting\/\">accounts<\/a> that aim to follow all the app&#8217;s users were following north of 45,000 people. However, according to the FAQ <a href=\"https:\/\/blueskyweb.xyz\/faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">published by Bluesky today,<\/a> the company says the community now has north of 50,000 users.<\/p>\n<p>The FAQ also attempts to clarify how access to invite codes will be distributed, noting that existing users receive just one invite every two weeks they&#8217;re on the app. Plus, the company shared that it periodically monitors the social graph, and if it finds that certain users are inviting &#8220;other trustworthy participants,&#8221; they&#8217;ll receive more invites.<\/p>\n<p>This aspect of the invite system makes Bluesky feel even more exclusive than if it were just slowly rolling out access to its waitlist. Instead, getting in now feels like a function of who you know. This has led to existing Bluesky users being asked daily &#8212; often by multiple folks &#8212; if they have any invite codes to spare. (In other words, your best bet to get a Bluesky invite is to become an existing user&#8217;s best friend for the next two weeks!)<\/p>\n<p>Bluesky says it&#8217;s limiting access to grow the network &#8220;organically,&#8221; but if that were the case, it would roll out a few more codes or increase the frequency in order to capitalize on the real-world demand, because that would still be considered organic growth. At this point, restricting invites to one every two weeks is artificially slowing the app&#8217;s growth.<\/p>\n<p>That appears to be by design. The company explains its thinking in the FAQ, saying that it needs to limit bad actors up front.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Social networks can be abused by spammers and bad actors who might want to manipulate the public conversation. It\u2019s much easier to limit sign-ups and let them spread through an existing social graph than to try to retroactively clean up rampant network abuse,&#8221; the post reads. &#8220;Long-term, we view this invite code system as a piece of the open source tooling we\u2019re building to help server admins (people running services) to help curate and moderate their communities,&#8221; it says.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear if the company believes its existing user base can&#8217;t be trusted to give out invites responsibly, or if it wants to have more of a hand in who gets in &#8212; and who stays out. But with Bluesky invites now selling to the highest bidder on eBay, the company&#8217;s plans for keeping out bad actors could be disrupted.<\/p>\n<p>The FAQ details other aspects of Bluesky&#8217;s plans, including its <a href=\"https:\/\/atproto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AT Protocol<\/a> for decentralization, and its differentiators from Twitter, like <a href=\"https:\/\/blueskyweb.xyz\/blog\/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">algorithmic choice<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blueskyweb.xyz\/blog\/4-13-2023-moderation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">composable moderation.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It also tries to clear up the nature of Bluesky&#8217;s relationship to Twitter, as it was originally incubated in Twitter while Jack Dorsey was CEO. It was later <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bluesky\/status\/1518707599843028992\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spun out as<\/a> an independent company (a PBLLC), having <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bluesky\/status\/1518707604750430208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">received $13 million<\/a> from Twitter to kickstart its launch. Now, the FAQ notes that &#8220;Twitter closed its service agreement with Bluesky in 2022.&#8221; Jack Dorsey is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/4205dfd0-c02c-4591-b7c3-0076dcc654fa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">still on Bluesky&#8217;s board<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Bluesky was asked for comment on the new figures, but an automated response to press inquiries only pointed us to the new FAQ.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Consumer demand for the Jack Dorsey-backed Twitter alternative Bluesky is outstripping access, according to the latest App Store data and figures published today by the company.

Apple&#8217;s AirTag being used for stalking or other criminal apps, Apple and Google today released a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2023\/05\/apple-google-partner-on-an-industry-specification-to-address-unwanted-tracking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">joint announcement<\/a> saying they will work together to lead an industry-wide initiative to draft a specification that would alert users in the case of unwanted tracking from Bluetooth devices. The companies said they&#8217;re seeking input from other industry participants and advocacy groups in the matter, and noted that other tracker makers like Samsung, Tile, Chipolo, eufy Security and Pebblebee have also expressed interest in the draft.<\/p>\n<p>The companies submitted a proposed <a href=\"https:\/\/datatracker.ietf.org\/doc\/draft-detecting-unwanted-location-trackers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">specification<\/a> as an Internet-Draft via a standards development organization, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ietf.org\/about\/introduction\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Internet Engineering Task Force<\/a> (IETF). Other interested parties are now being invited to review and comment over the next three months. After this time, Apple and Google will offer feedback and will release a production implementation of the specification by year&#8217;s end that will be supported in future versions of iOS and Android, they said.<\/p>\n<p>While Apple&#8217;s AirTag wasn&#8217;t the first Bluetooth tracker on the market to present security concerns around misuse &#8212; Tile and others had existed for years &#8212; Apple&#8217;s ability to integrate AirTag with the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/02\/02\/apple-two-billion-active-devices\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a02 billion+ Apple devices globally<\/a>, including its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/27\/22253162\/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 1 billion iPhones<\/a>, as part of its &#8220;Find My&#8221; network, made it one of the largest players almost immediately. It also popularized the then-still niche technology of using Bluetooth trackers to find lost items, making the devices for doing so a household name.<\/p>\n<p>Soon, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/12\/30\/technology\/apple-airtags-tracking-stalking.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stories<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2022\/jan\/20\/apple-airtags-stalking-complaints-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">began<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-60004257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">emerge<\/a> that AirTags were being used for stalking and other concerns, like car theft. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/apple-to-address-airtag-stalking-problem-with-upcoming-features\/\">Apple in February 2022 announced<\/a> it would work to address some of the problems it had created with new features, including new privacy warnings, alerts and expanded documentation. Hoping to deter misuse, it also said it was actively working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/privacy\/law-enforcement-guidelines-us.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">law enforcement<\/a> on all AirTag-related requests it receives, and confirmed it was able to provide the account details in response to a subpoena or other valid law enforcement request.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"gVHR66bYv6\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/apple-to-address-airtag-stalking-problem-with-upcoming-features\/\">Apple to address AirTag stalking problem with upcoming features<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple to address AirTag stalking problem with upcoming features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/02\/10\/apple-to-address-airtag-stalking-problem-with-upcoming-features\/embed\/#?secret=SN2bz1uDT9#?secret=gVHR66bYv6\" data-secret=\"gVHR66bYv6\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Today, the company along with Google, wants to make these safety measures more of a standard, rather than just a feature set. This includes building on the AirTag protections Apple had already released but also, critically, ensuring that users would be able to combat unwanted tracking by offering tools across both iOS and Android platforms. Today, for instance, Apple offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tracker Detect app for Android users<\/a>, but it doesn&#8217;t work as well as Apple&#8217;s own Find My app because it requires users to actively scan for tags, rather than receive proactive warnings and alerts. The new spec, meanwhile, wants to make unwanted tracking alerts work across any platform.<\/p>\n<p>Various advocacy groups praised the effort in today&#8217;s announcement, including the National Network to End Domestic Violence and the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology. The former had been advocating for a universal standard to protect survivors from the misuse of trackers and noted, in a statement, it was &#8216;encouraged by this progress.&#8221; The latter referred to the move as a &#8220;welcome step&#8221; to prevent the misuse of these devices.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Google and Apple have worked together before on products that benefit their respective customer bases, including with <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/04\/10\/apple-and-google-are-launching-a-joint-covid-19-tracing-tool\/\">the development of the COVID-19 tracing tool for iOS And Android users<\/a> in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Just ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, AirTag had a boost of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/05\/01\/nypd-encourages-car-owners-to-use-airtags\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">good press with news<\/a> that the New York Police Department was encouraging car owners to use AirTag to prevent car theft, which increased following <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/21\/kia-hyundai-sued-after-viral-tiktok-causes-rise-in-thefts\/\">TikTok viral videos<\/a> demonstrating hot wiring Kia and Hyundai vehicles.

of Fire TV Channels, its new, free and ad-supported (FAST) video experience coming to Fire TV devices this week. Though Fire TV had previously offered FAST content, Fire TV Channels will now be continuously updated throughout the day and integrated into several areas across the Fire TV interface, including on Home Screen rows, within Fire TV&#8217;s &#8220;Free&#8221; tab, and in category-specific pages devoted to certain genres.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Fire TV is gaining a set of new FAST channels from NHL, Xbox, and TMZ, as well as a new Travel category featuring content from Tastemade Travel, &#8220;Rick Steves&#8217; Europe,&#8221; &#8220;Travel Hacks,&#8221; and soon, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler. Later, Fire TV Channels will also include content from the PGA.<\/p>\n<p>The company explained this Fire TV update was informed by customer behavior and the increasing demand for free streaming content.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve offered some of this [FAST] content for a while for customers &#8212; we&#8217;ve helped them discover it throughout the [user interface] by having rows of content for example throughout &#8216;Home&#8217; or other pages,&#8221; explains Charlotte Maines, director of Advertising, Monetization, Marketing and Engagement for Fire TV. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen that they&#8217;ve been engaging with it when we surface it in a topical way&#8230;And what we&#8217;ve seen in the past six months alone is that the monthly hours streamed of this content have grown by 300%. So we know it&#8217;s working for our customers,&#8221; she added.<\/p>\n<p>The growth can be attributed to several factors, the exec said. For one, customers have hit a sort of saturation point with streaming video-on-demand offerings and don&#8217;t have interest in adding more subscriptions to their monthly bills, nor do they want to try to keep up with any more services. By comparison, FAST channels are easy to use because users don&#8217;t have to create an account, sign in, or jump through any other hoops to start watching.<\/p>\n<p>With the update, the Fire TV interface will now pull all the new and existing FAST content together in an updated experience that provides access to a variety of categories like news, sports, food and cooking, music videos, trailers, gaming videos, comedy, and more, Maines notes.<\/p>\n<p>The news category includes access to both national news coverage as well as over 330 local news channels, including as of later this week, new FAST channels from NBC and Telemundo.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>These category pages can be accessed with just a click from Fire TV&#8217;s &#8220;Free&#8221; tab, and Amazon says more categories are &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe class=\"embed-iframe embed-iframe--youtube\" title=\"Fire TV Unveils Fire TV Channels at NewFronts\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/LvcKKyn0p28?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The update was announced as part of Amazon&#8217;s broader NewFronts presentation, which also included <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/01\/amazon-will-juice-its-freevee-free-streaming-service-with-100-amazon-originals-in-2023\/\">updates to its free streaming service Freevee<\/a> &#8212; which offers FAST channels of its own. But Freevee is accessible across platforms, including on mobile devices and other non-Amazon media players and TVs, while Fire TV Channels are exclusive to Fire TV.<\/p>\n<p>The company&#8217;s pitch to advertisers is that they can now directly target the Fire TV customer base, which tends to include Prime subscribers and younger families, through <a href=\"https:\/\/advertising.amazon.com\/solutions\/products\/video-ads?ref_=a20m_us_p_dsp_faq_va\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon&#8217;s DSP<\/a>. This lets Amazon leverage the company&#8217;s broader advertising team and capabilities to sell Fire TV&#8217;s FAST channel ad space.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon notes it&#8217;s sold over 200 million Fire TV devices globally and Amazon&#8217;s ad-supported streaming solutions now reach an average of 155 million unduplicated monthly viewers, or 6 out of 10 adults in the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>The company also cited a customer success story where an automotive client ran native ads on Fire TV and Fire tablets that led to an 11% lift in brand awareness and a 14% increase in purchase intent. Plus, citing Nielsen data, Amazon said 72% of its streaming TV viewers are not watching linear TV.<\/p>\n<p>Amazon isn&#8217;t the only streamer offering FAST channels these days, however. Competitor Roku has <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/09\/rokus-latest-software-update-brings-local-news-more-live-sports-and-a-new-mobile-app\/\">over 350 FAST channels<\/a> on its platform as of March. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/11\/google-tv-expands-its-free-streaming-lineup-to-over-800-live-tv-channels-including-tubi-plex-haystack-and-more\/\">Google TV just announced over 800 FAST channels<\/a>, and YouTube has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/17\/youtube-test-fast-channels-hub\/\">experimenting<\/a> with them, as well. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/05\/streamer-plex-finally-ready-to-launch-a-tv-and-movie-rentals-marketplace\/\">Plex<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/warner-bros-discovery-reaches-deals-with-roku-and-tubi-to-license-2000-hours-of-content-including-westworld\/\">Warner Bros. Discovery<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/03\/tubi-reports-record-growth-expands-original-content-and-linear-channel-offerings\/\">Tubi<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/09\/sling-tv-launches-free-ad-supported-streaming-tv-service-sling-freestream\/\">Sling TV<\/a>, among others, are also wading into this market, historically led by services like<a href=\"https:\/\/pluto.tv\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Pluto TV<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The new Fire TV experience will be rolling out to customers this week, Amazon said. Customers will be able to find the new content tiles via the Fire TV Home Screen, as well as within Fire TV&#8217;s &#8220;Free&#8221; tab. Later this summer, Fire TV will bring all the FAST categories together with the launch of an always-on Fire TV Channels destination.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hnq5MQWpXp\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/01\/amazon-will-juice-its-freevee-free-streaming-service-with-100-amazon-originals-in-2023\/\">Amazon will juice its Freevee free streaming service with 100+ Amazon Originals in 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Amazon will juice its Freevee free streaming service with 100+ Amazon Originals in 2023&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/01\/amazon-will-juice-its-freevee-free-streaming-service-with-100-amazon-originals-in-2023\/embed\/#?secret=S9lFZBqJMj#?secret=hnq5MQWpXp\" data-secret=\"hnq5MQWpXp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amazon is doubling down on free, ad-supported content with today&#8217;s introduction of Fire TV Channels, its new, free and ad-supported (FAST) video experience coming to Fire TV devices this week.

After TechCrunch reported earlier today that Twitter was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/01\/blue-checks-reappear-on-twitter-if-you-update-your-bio-lmao\/\">experiencing a bug<\/a> that was allowing people to edit their bios to briefly regain their Verified check marks, the Twitter website this afternoon has begun to forcefully log out users at random. There are a number of complaints about the problem on Twitter itself, indicating that at least some are able to get back in after being booted from the site.<\/p>\n<p>The issue appears to be impacting desktop users at this time who are using Twitter via the web. Some claim they&#8217;re being logged out repeatedly.<\/p>\n<p>The issue occurs when you&#8217;re browsing the Twitter website, we found. The page refreshes and then Twitter users (including several of us here at TechCrunch) are taken to the default website for Logged Out users. This page shows a curated selection of tweets and options to sign in through Google or Apple or by creating a new account. Many people (tweeting via their phones, we guess) say they&#8217;re unable to get back into the site through any of the usual methods.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;re facing that problem, too, having gotten to the screen where we can enter the code from a code generator app. But after the code is entered, the page only refreshes and returns us to the same Logged Out page once again.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/downdetector.com\/status\/twitter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Downdetector<\/a> website also shows a sharp increase in user complaints about the site, indicating the problem is fairly widespread.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2536155\" style=\"width: 1514px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2536155\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2536155 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1504\" height=\"632\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg 1504w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg?resize=150,63 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg?resize=300,126 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg?resize=768,323 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg?resize=680,286 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg?resize=1200,504 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screenshot-2023-05-01-at-4.13.04-PM.jpg?resize=50,21 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2536155\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Downdetector<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Twitter has yet to acknowledge the problem via its official Twitter or Twitter Support accounts. A tech reporter at The New York Times, Ryan Mac, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RMac18\/status\/1653244947477458944\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted<\/a> that the issue was caused by a bad front-end deployment, sources said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The bug is yet another example of the growing slate of issues that have followed Elon Musk&#8217;s takeover of the social network and the significant layoffs of engineering staff that the transition entailed. Since then, Twitter has experienced a range of problems, including <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/10\/twitter-circle-bug-not-private\/\">glitches with Twitter Circle<\/a> that showed private tweets to the public, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/01\/twitter-timeline-is-broken-for-multiple-users\/\">broken timelines<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/06\/twitter-images-and-links-are-currently-broken\/\">broken links and images<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/08\/twitter-tweet-limit-bug-error\/\">misfired error messages<\/a>, and it experienced <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/12\/28\/twitter-down-outage\/\">multiple<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/04\/twitter-goes-down-for-many-in-australia-users-say\/\">outages<\/a>. At the same time, the company is pitching itself to advertisers and creators, and suggesting its future will involve becoming a super app that also offers payments.<\/p>\n<p>Over the weekend, in fact, Musk even touted how media publishers &#8212; a group he recently alienated by <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/17\/twitter-adds-more-government-funded-labels-to-global-news-outlets\/\">dubbing outlets like NPR and PBS &#8220;government-funded&#8221;<\/a> &#8212; would be able to offer micropayments for individual articles through Twitter. A similar concept is now being <a href=\"https:\/\/post.news\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">trialed by Twitter rival Post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether any of Twitter&#8217;s big plans will ever gain traction, however.<\/p>\n<p>After all, it&#8217;s hard to sell much of anything on a website users can&#8217;t access.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PIbcA1zEel\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/01\/blue-checks-reappear-on-twitter-if-you-update-your-bio-lmao\/\">Blue checks reappear on Twitter if you update your bio, lmao<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Blue checks reappear on Twitter if you update your bio, lmao&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/01\/blue-checks-reappear-on-twitter-if-you-update-your-bio-lmao\/embed\/#?secret=4YViTrw6Vg#?secret=PIbcA1zEel\" data-secret=\"PIbcA1zEel\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Twitter is not dead yet; it&#8217;s just randomly logging out a number of its users.

To accomplish this, RTRO divides its social experience into two parts &#8212; on one side, you can keep up with friends or family in RTRO&#8217;s &#8220;circles.&#8221; On the other side, users can switch over to see content from creators and brands in their own space.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/rtro-logontolife\/id6444858070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RTRO<\/a> claims to offer robust content moderation features that focus on keeping the app free from bullying and toxicity and the ability to interact with ChatGPT.<\/p>\n<p>Founded by two tech and marketing veterans, the startup&#8217;s approach to social is one that aims to take users back to a simpler time when social networks were focused more on sharing real content and making connections with other people. This nostalgia for earlier days is reflected in the app&#8217;s name, &#8220;RTRO,&#8221; a misspelling of &#8220;retro.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>After polling Gen Z and millennial users, the team found that people&#8217;s top complaints about today&#8217;s social media apps were about the number of brand ads showing up in users&#8217; feeds and the algorithm-driven experience. But people also said they wanted to use social media to stay connected with others they care about and to view entertaining content.<\/p>\n<p>Brands, too, had shared their own complaints about modern social media, RTRO&#8217;s founders explained.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2534202\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2534202\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2534202 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?resize=150,87 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?resize=300,175 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?resize=768,448 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?resize=680,396 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?resize=1200,699 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/04\/image-1.png?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2534202\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> RTRO<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>With a background in experiential marketing, co-founders Nicole Falco and Tristan Brennan had worked with hundreds of Fortune 500 and 1000 brands over the years, including at Brennan&#8217;s marketing agency TH Experiential. This work included the creation of several digital products, apps and websites for brands to engage with customers globally. But the brands would often express to them their confusion and frustration around integrating social into their campaigns.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;TikTok is still a little bit of a mystery for them, and then on [Instagram], ever-changing rules and ever-changing features and algorithms just make it a challenge for brands to figure out how to get in front of who they need to,&#8221; said Falco.<\/p>\n<p>These complaints from both users and brands got the founders thinking about how they can create something better.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We were looking at social media through the lens of the human experience, and how can we make it a little better, and also through the lens of technology, what technology can be leveraged?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2535998\" style=\"width: 319px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2535998\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"vertical wp-image-2535998\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?w=383\" alt=\"\" width=\"309\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png 3240w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=84,150 84w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=169,300 169w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=383,680 383w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=1152,2048 1152w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=675,1200 675w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/RTRO-ContentSurfing-9_16.png?resize=28,50 28w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 309px) 100vw, 309px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2535998\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> RTRO<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The end result is RTRO, a social app where you can toggle between your personal connections and brand and creator content, as they each have their own spaces. On the personal side, there aren&#8217;t any brands interrupting the experience &#8212; however, they do have a way to stay involved. RTRO prompts users a few times a week to post &#8212; encouraging posts of affirmations, GIFs or updates about what you&#8217;re doing in real life (hashtagged as #LogOntoLife). Brands can sponsor these prompts, if they choose.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the other side of the app &#8212; aka RTRO TV &#8212; is an algorithm-free space where brands and creators intersect with their audience in a chat-style environment. At launch, RTRO has around 50 TikTok and Instagram creators making content for the app. Users can react to their posts, like giving it a thumbs up, but not message or comment. To engage with RTRO TV, users browse through various &#8220;channels&#8221; dedicated to topics like travel, food, beauty and more. This puts users more in control of what sort of content they see in their feeds, the company says.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;You can go to that channel and you can explore brand and creator content &#8212; so you&#8217;re in full control of seeing what you want to see. This is completely new. This type of experience does not currently exist in an app,&#8221; Falco touts.<\/p>\n<p>However, the offering is similar in some ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/16\/tiktok-adds-dedicated-video-feeds-for-sports-fashion-gaming-and-food\/\">TikTok&#8217;s test of dedicated, topical feeds.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In addition, creators can choose to create a private circle and post to it within their channel space. When finished, they can turn the circle off. Creators can also block users from messaging in the circle or remove them if they&#8217;re being hateful or toxic.<\/p>\n<p>Creators RTRO has tested with said they liked the ability to have more personal and casual conversations with followers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;In these channels, people with several hundred thousand followers are finding they can post one post to Instagram a day &#8212; it has a very tailored image,&#8221; says Brennan. But in the channels, they can now post many times a day, he explains. &#8220;They can have an informal conversation. It doesn&#8217;t have to feel so official [or like] their one moment to stand out.

The company <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/poparazzi\/peace-out-poparazzi-34bd37e0e519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced<\/a> the news via a Medium blog late last week, informing users that the app would be discontinued and users had until June 30, 2023 to download their content. Last year, Poparazzi&#8217;s founders at TTYL Inc. said the app had grown to 5+ million total installs and confirmed its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/01\/poparazzi-hits-5m-downloads-a-year-after-launch-confirms-its-15m-series-a\/\">raise of $15 million in Series A<\/a> funding.<\/p>\n<p>Though Poparazzi had felt at the time like an overnight sensation, co-founder and CEO\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexanderwma\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Ma<\/a> and his brother, co-founder Austen Ma, had spent three years developing apps and pivoting to achieve the success they generated with Poparrazi&#8217;s launch. In a 2022 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/01\/poparazzi-hits-5m-downloads-a-year-after-launch-confirms-its-15m-series-a\/\">interview<\/a> with TechCrunch, Alex said Poparrazi was actually the 11th or 12th app that was generated by those efforts. Among those was the audio social network, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/ttyl-inc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TTYL<\/a>, a sort of \u201cClubhouse for friends,&#8221; which their company is also named for.<\/p>\n<p>Poparrazi, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/26\/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store\/\">generated a lot of hype<\/a> soon after its release, climbing the charts to reach No. 1 on the App Store. The concept behind the app was a photo-sharing-focused social network that essentially took Instagram&#8217;s tagging feature and turned it into the entire experience. On Poparazzi, users could tag their friends but couldn&#8217;t post photos of their own. The idea was that this would create a more authentic type of social network, as photos wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be the polished, perfected images that fill Instagram, but rather the casual moments that make up people&#8217;s real lives.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2328718\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2328718\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2328718\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"419\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg 5439w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=1536,945 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=2048,1261 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=1200,739 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/How-It-Works-poparazzi.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2328718\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Poparazzi<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Last June, the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/01\/poparazzi-hits-5m-downloads-a-year-after-launch-confirms-its-15m-series-a\/\">company confirmed its $15 million Series A raise<\/a> led by Benchmark&#8217;s Sarah Tavel, who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newcomer.co\/p\/scoop-benchmark-nabs-series-a-in?s=r\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beat out<\/a> a16z for the deal. The startup had previously raised $2 million in seed funding, led by Floodgate, in a round that included other investors like SV Angel, Shrug Capital and various angels. At the time, Poparazzi said its funds would give its team of 15 a runway of over two years.<\/p>\n<p>But soon, there were signs that Poparazzi&#8217;s time could be coming to an end.<\/p>\n<p>In August 2022, TechCrunch spotted the team was now dabbling with a new app, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/08\/30\/following-its-series-a-poparazzis-team-is-readying-a-new-social-app-that-goes-beyond-photos\/\">Made with Friends<\/a>, that offered a twist on Poparazzi\u2019s original concept of social networking profiles crafted by a user\u2019s friends. Made with Friends instead asked its users to post all sorts of content to their friends&#8217; profiles, not just photos. For example, they could post text-based content like answers to questions or prompts, as well as videos. The app had been available as a pre-release at that time, but it&#8217;s since been removed from the App Store sometime after March 26 of this year, app intelligence firm Apptopia confirmed to TechCrunch.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Usage for Poparrazi had also been slowing post-launch, the firm noted. It estimated there were 6.2 million lifetime installs for the app, but it now has only around 2,000-3,000 monthly active users (MAUs) after reaching a height of 4 million MAUs previously.<\/p>\n<p>In its blog post, Poparrazi didn&#8217;t confirm its future plans, if any, only noting the impending shutdown and thanking its community and supporters.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We\u2019ve been incredibly blessed to work with an amazing team of passionate designers, engineers, and marketers to help bring this movement to life. And none of this would have been possible without the backing from the most supportive, world-class group of investors,&#8221; wrote Alex Ma, in the announcement. &#8220;To our community, we are so grateful for the support and belief that you have shown us throughout our journey. Your enthusiasm and passion for Poparazzi has been the driving force behind everything we\u2019ve done. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>TTYL Inc. has been asked for comment. Alex Ma responded, after publication, that while the company didn\u2019t have an official statement to share, they could confirm it was winding down and would be returning capital to investors. The team, however, will stay together and work on other projects.<\/p>\n<p>Updated 5\/1\/23, 8:53 pm et with company response.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Poparazzi, the once-hot photo-sharing app that hit the top of the App Store in 2021, is shutting down.

With its invite-only status, native mobile apps and ability to attract the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/27\/blueskys-best-shot-at-success-is-to-embrace-shitposting\/\">always online, shitposting crowd,<\/a> the app has been getting buzz this past week as users invited their friends, bringing the network to somewhere around 40,000+ users.<\/p>\n<p>Bluesky today moves quickly, giving posters the dopamine rush of Twitter-level attention at times. People are vying to reach to its &#8220;What&#8217;s Hot&#8221; feed and are arguing about whether or not these pseudo-tweets should be called &#8220;posts&#8221; or &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2023\/4\/27\/23701551\/bluesky-skeets-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">skeets<\/a>&#8221; &#8212; the latter against the wishes of the CEO Jay Graber, who <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/jay.bsky.team\/post\/3juflvnb3d62u\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">is begging<\/a> for anything else, even &#8220;skoots.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>To what extent she&#8217;ll have any sway over the matter remains to be seen.

There aren&#8217;t many (any?) right-wingers getting into arguments with leftists. There are few legit celebs or high-profile figures on board, beyond folks like Chrissy Teigen and AOC and a few others.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, Bluesky feels like a weird afterparty where everyone is a little too drunk, a little too tired and has lost their filter.<\/p>\n<p>This vibe may not last and neither may its appeal. It remains to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>While &#8220;party Twitter&#8221; is a fun place to be for a time, it isn&#8217;t necessarily a fulfilling meal &#8212; just a sugary snack. That could leave some people returning to more robust networks, like Twitter or Mastodon to engage in more thoughtful discussions. And it may turn off some potential Bluesky users who aren&#8217;t a fan of the shitposting culture.<\/p>\n<p>For others, however, a place that&#8217;s all brouhaha and no baggage may be just what they want.<\/p>\n<p>There are also things the app needs to address before it opens more publicly. For now, it&#8217;s lacking many of the features people expect &#8212; like the ability to view your past likes, bookmark items, create lists, block users, use hashtags, DM others, perform advanced searches and more. This gives the network a bit of an ephemeral feeling, as posts &#8212; or skeets &#8212; quickly move down the feed, never to be seen again.<\/p>\n<p>Despite its issues, Bluesky recalls the early days of the social web where trying new apps was actually fun. That&#8217;s the nature of its invite-only status, which is keeping the party small with a bouncer at the door.<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you want to join us on Bluesky, give us a follow.<\/p>\n<p>TechCrunch team members on Bluesky include me &#8212;<a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/sarahp.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Sarah Perez<\/a> (@sarahp), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/ralts.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amanda Silberling<\/a> (@ralts), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/bheater.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brian Heater<\/a> (@bheater), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/did:plc:ymxxl4koa3rj3nngc7vazirh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Frederic Lardinois<\/a> (@fredericl), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/did:plc:g7jnrvgktcbnsvcr3lgwcbdx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Romain Dillet<\/a> (@romain), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/panz.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matthew Panzarino<\/a> (@panz), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/darrelletherington.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Darrell Etherington<\/a> (@darrelletherington.com), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/ronmiller.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ron Miller<\/a> (@ronmiller), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/alexwilhelm.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Wilhelm<\/a> (@alexwilhem), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/becca.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Becca Szkutak<\/a> (@becca), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/mehtology.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ivan Mehta<\/a> (@methology), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/dicebourbon.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bryce Durbin<\/a> (@dicebourbon), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/did:plc:4zw5tloy5ra5f56femmjpj5l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Henry Pickavet<\/a> (@pickavet), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/mirandahalpern.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Miranda Halpern<\/a> (@mirandahalpern), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/morgansung.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morgan Sung<\/a> (@morgansung), <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/natashathereporter.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Natasha Mascarenhas<\/a> (@natashareporter) and <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/profile\/lorenzofb.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai<\/a> (@lorenzofb).<\/p>\n<p><em>(Those links should work when logged into the web app at <a href=\"https:\/\/staging.bsky.app\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">staging.bsky.app<\/a>.

But following the chatbot\u2019s rollout to Snapchat\u2019s wider community, Snapchat\u2019s app has seen a spike in negative reviews amid a growing number of complaints shared on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past week, Snapchat\u2019s average U.S. App Store review was 1.67, with 75% of reviews being one-star, according to data from app intelligence firm\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/sensortower.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sensor Tower<\/a>. For comparison, across Q1 2023, the Snapchat average U.S. App Store review was 3.05, with only 35% of reviews being one-star.<\/p>\n<p>The number of daily reviews has also increased by five times over the last week, the firm noted.<\/p>\n<p>Another app data provider,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.apptopia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apptopia<\/a>, reports a similar trend. Its analysis shows \u201cAI\u201d was the top keyword in Snapchat\u2019s App Store reviews over the past seven days, where it was mentioned 2,973 times. The firm has given the term an \u201cImpact Score\u201d rating of -9.2. This Impact Score is a weighted index that measures the effect a term has on sentiment and ranges from -10 to +10.<\/p>\n<p>Apptopia also said that Snapchat received around 3x more one-star ratings than usual on April 20, 2023. That\u2019s the day after\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/19\/snapchat-opens-its-ai-chatbot-to-global-users-says-the-ai-will-later-snap-you-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the My AI global release was announced<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Many Snapchat users aren\u2019t thrilled with My AI, which appeared inside their app without warning or their consent. For some, it\u2019s the chatbot\u2019s placement that\u2019s the cause of concern. My AI is pinned to the top of users\u2019 Chat feed inside the app and can\u2019t be unpinned, blocked or removed, as other conversations can be. Many are also pushing back at the fact that removing the My AI from their Chat feed requires a Snapchat+ subscription &#8212; effectively forcing them to pay to get their app back to normal.<\/p>\n<p>Other users found the AI creepy, as it seemed to know their location even if they hadn&#8217;t explicitly shared it.<\/p>\n<p>In response to the ongoing complaints, Snap <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/26\/snap-says-its-bot-wont-notice-instantly-that-you-stopped-sharing-your-location\/\">published an explainer<\/a>. It said the AI would have your location data if you were already using Snap Map and if you disabled location sharing, there could be a temporary delay (due to caching, we understand) before the AI would no longer have access to that data. Snap also said it made updates to My AI that clarify when it is aware of a Snapchatter\u2019s location, and when it isn\u2019t. Now, when users open My AI for the first time, they&#8217;ll receive a notice explaining that it may use the information they share with Snapchat to personalize its responses.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"jMQogGFFVo\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/24\/snapchat-sees-spike-in-1-star-reviews-as-users-pan-the-my-ai-feature-calling-for-its-removal\/\">Snapchat sees spike in 1-star reviews as users pan the &#8216;My AI&#8217; feature, calling for its removal<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat sees spike in 1-star reviews as users pan the &#8216;My AI&#8217; feature, calling for its removal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/24\/snapchat-sees-spike-in-1-star-reviews-as-users-pan-the-my-ai-feature-calling-for-its-removal\/embed\/#?secret=vFFnGqodNQ#?secret=jMQogGFFVo\" data-secret=\"jMQogGFFVo\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h3>Apple and Meta beat antitrust lawsuits; Apple&#8217;s battle was with Epic Games, Meta with state AGs<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2348713\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2348713\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2348713\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"Apple logo at entrance to an Apple store\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg 5568w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/GettyImages-1235254642.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2348713\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Nicholas Kamm \/ AFP \/ Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Apple this week <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/24\/apple-wins-antitrust-court-battle-with-epic-games-appeals-court-rules\/\">won its antitrust-focused appeals<\/a> court battle with Fortnite maker Epic Games over its App Store policies, according to the opinion issued today by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court largely upheld the district court\u2019s earlier ruling related to Epic Games\u2019 antitrust claims in favor of Apple, but it also upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment in favor of Epic under California\u2019s Unfair Competition Law.<\/p>\n<p>The ruling is a major setback for Epic Games and other developers who hoped the ruling could set a precedent for further antitrust claims and require Apple to open iOS devices to third-party app stores and payment systems.

You can also tap the \u201cCreate Playlist\u201d button, to give the AI-built playlist a name, then open it up in Apple Music\u2019s app and begin listening.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"bo2Iwyi8cx\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/18\/this-week-in-apps-ai-powered-productivity-apps-us-weighs-tiktok-ban-svb-crash-boosts-crypto-apps\/\">This Week in Apps: AI-powered productivity apps, US weighs TikTok ban, SVB crash boosts crypto apps<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;This Week in Apps: AI-powered productivity apps, US weighs TikTok ban, SVB crash boosts crypto apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/18\/this-week-in-apps-ai-powered-productivity-apps-us-weighs-tiktok-ban-svb-crash-boosts-crypto-apps\/embed\/#?secret=gBpL8kRZFJ#?secret=bo2Iwyi8cx\" data-secret=\"bo2Iwyi8cx\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/this-week-in-apps\/\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1952542\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"93\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png 2047w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=150,21 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=300,41 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=768,105 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=680,93 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=1536,210 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=1200,164 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/this-week-in-apps-banner2.png?resize=50,7 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.

multiyear strategic ad partnership with Amazon aimed at bringing more brands and relevant products to its platform. The new deal will make the e-commerce giant Pinterest&#8217;s first partner on third-party ads, the company said in a blog post shared alongside its<a href=\"https:\/\/investor.pinterestinc.com\/press-releases\/press-releases-details\/2023\/Pinterest-Announces-First-Quarter-2023-Results\/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0first-quarter earnings<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/pinterest-delivers-earnings-beat-will-partner-with-amazon-as-it-opens-third-party-ad-demand-7e935544?mod=retail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beat<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The partnership is a step in a new direction for the image sharing and social media site, which has been working to adjust to consumers&#8217; changing interests around product discovery in recent years. As demand for video platforms like TikTok and Reels grew, Pinterest&#8217;s image pinboard began to feel dated, leading it to launch its <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/18\/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-a-video-first-feature-aimed-at-creators\/\">video-first Idea Pins<\/a> and increase its investment in creator content.<\/p>\n<p>But some of those <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/11\/30\/pinterest-shuts-down-its-creator-rewards-program\/?guccounter=1\">creator efforts were recently wound down<\/a>, ahead of Pinterest&#8217;s last-quarter <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/02\/06\/pinterest-pins-earnings-q4-2022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">miss on revenue<\/a> where the company warned also of low first-quarter sales, sending its shares down.<\/p>\n<p>By comparison, Amazon&#8217;s digital ads unit in the same quarter did well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2023\/02\/02\/amazons-advertising-business-grew-19percent-unlike-google-meta.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">jumping 19%<\/a> to $11.6 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Like other tech companies, Pinterest has been struggling with the macroeconomic forces impacting its business, but promised it was working to adapt to the changing environment. The company also laid off 150 employees in February as it <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/01\/pinterest-lays-off-150-people-as-a-part-of-its-long-term-strategy\/\">tried to reduce expenses<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While Pinterest has for years worked to connect product inspiration to purchases, the Amazon ads partnership could potentially offer consumers a more seamless buying experience. Unlike on some e-commerce websites, Amazon shoppers may not have to fiddle with filling out forms, as most have their payment information already on file with the company, leading to faster checkouts.<\/p>\n<p>When users click on an Amazon ad on Pinterest, they&#8217;ll be taken directly to Amazon to make the purchase, Pinterest says.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Over 463 million people come to Pinterest each month to create a life they love. Brands and products are a critical piece of this journey, enabling Pinners to move easily from inspiration to action and advertisers to realize value in connecting with users with high commercial intent,&#8221; Pinterest noted in its blog post. &#8220;Our partnership with Amazon will allow us to scale these efforts in meaningful ways,&#8221; it said.<\/p>\n<p>The company noted the implementation of the Amazon ads integrations will take place over multiple quarters, starting later this year. Pinterest can&#8217;t yet say where the ads will appear to end users and it&#8217;s not making any near-term forecasts related to revenue impacts, noting it may not see meaningful impact until next year.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAmazon Ads is delighted to partner with Pinterest and make it even easier for customers to discover and buy relevant products through shoppable content, while also providing differentiated value for brands,&#8221; add Amazon SVP Paul Kotas, in a statement.<\/p>\n<p>Pinterest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/pinterest-delivers-earnings-beat-will-partner-with-amazon-as-it-opens-third-party-ad-demand-7e935544?mod=retail\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beat<\/a> on Q1 revenue and earnings, with revenue up 5% year over year to $603 million, ahead of $598 million expected, and adjusted EPS of $0.08 versus $0.02 expected. Global monthly active users were up 7% year over year to $463 million. The company also reported a GAAP net loss of $209 million, or 31 cents per share, up from 1 cent per share in the year-ago period.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the earnings beat, Pinterest stock <a href=\"https:\/\/seekingalpha.com\/news\/3961680-pinterest-falls-6-as-q1-beats-but-q2-costs-ramp-higher?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Amarket-news%7Csection_asset%3Amain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dropped 6%<\/a> on higher Q2 costs.<\/p>\n<p><em>More to come.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Pinterest today announced a multiyear strategic ad partnership with Amazon aimed at bringing more brands and relevant products to its platform.

I\/O developer conference in May. If rolled out publicly, the change could significantly expand the company&#8217;s Play Store search ads business by offering developers access to new prime real estate for their app marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>The test comes two years after Apple made a similar move with<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/05\/apple-expands-its-ad-business-with-a-new-app-store-ad-slot\/\"> the addition of a new ad slot<\/a> that appeared on the store&#8217;s Search tab itself, instead of only at the top of search results, as before.<\/p>\n<p>Similar to Apple, Google is also testing an ad slot that appears when Android users navigate to the Play Store&#8217;s search menu, where they can type in keywords to find apps. The test was first spotted by the Android news site, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.androidpolice.com\/google-play-store-search-ads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Android Police<\/a>, which noted that Google had been testing app &#8220;recommendations&#8221; in this slot as of late last year. When queried about those app promos at the time, Google had clarified they weren&#8217;t ads, just personalized suggestions.<\/p>\n<p>Now, that&#8217;s changed as the same spot includes both app recommendations and suggestions that are actually labeled as ads. (A few examples can be found in <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MishaalRahman\/status\/1650894932918321154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Twitter thread here<\/a>.) The ads aren&#8217;t yet showing for everyone, however, which indicated this was likely a test, as Google has since confirmed.<\/p>\n<p>Users have reported seeing the test in multiple markets worldwide, so it&#8217;s not a U.S.-only update.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--twitter\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yes.<br \/>Google Play Store is showing ads in search bar. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Pmf0Q1EPb8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pic.twitter.com\/Pmf0Q1EPb8<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&mdash; Sumanth \ud83d\udc90 (@sumanthmee) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/sumanthmee\/status\/1650898897953505280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">April 25, 2023<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><\/div>\n<p>Reached for comment, a Google spokesperson confirmed the experiment by noting the company tests new features on the Play Store from time to time. However, they didn&#8217;t offer any further information about this specific ad test &#8212; a possible indication Google doesn&#8217;t want to spoil a planned announcement. Or perhaps, there&#8217;s no determination yet on an ETA for a public launch.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe regularly test new features and ad formats to improve app discovery for Play users and help developers reach their audience, but don\u2019t have anything specific to announce right now,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a new way to pull in revenue from Play Store ads could help Google boost its bottom line at a time when it&#8217;s had to make concessions on Play Store commissions. Due to new regulations and pressure from lawmakers, Google has been <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/01\/31\/spotifys-third-party-billing-option-has-now-reached-over-140-global-markets\/\">rolling out third-party billing options<\/a> to global markets, offering developers reduced fees if they don&#8217;t use Google&#8217;s own billing services. Spotify has been an earlier adopter of the program, and dating app Bumble is also planning to participate.<\/p>\n<p>The availability of new Play Store search ad slots could significantly impact Play Store revenues, if rolled out broadly. When Apple introduced new App Store ad slots last year in less prominent locations,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/new-apple-app-store-ads-1-billion-ad-revenue-2022-8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> experts forecast<\/a> the change could generate another billion in revenue for the tech giant, for example. Google doesn&#8217;t break out the size of its own Play Store Ads business, but it&#8217;s also likely a sizable figure. Data\u00a0from Statista had estimated Google Play <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/444476\/google-play-annual-revenue\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">generated<\/a> approximately $48 billion in 2021 through mobile apps.

The states alleged Meta had illegally maintained monopoly power in the social networking market through its acquisitions of photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014, and that it gained further power through data policies that harmed app developers.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;As the Court of Appeals rightly recognized, this case fundamentally mischaracterized the vibrant competitive ecosystem in which we operate,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson said, in a statement on the ruling. &#8220;In affirming the dismissal of this case, the court noted that this enforcement action was &#8216;odd&#8217; because we compete in an industry that is experiencing &#8216;rapid growth and innovation with no end in sight.&#8217; Moving forward, Meta will defend itself vigorously against the FTC\u2019s distortion of antitrust laws and attacks on an American success story that are contrary to the interests of people and businesses who value our services,&#8221; they added.<\/p>\n<p>The plaintiffs, which included the attorneys general from 48 U.S. states and territories, had first sued Meta in December 2020, but a federal court <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/06\/28\/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-against-facebook.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dismissed their case in 2021<\/a>, as well as a parallel case by the Federal Trade Commission, which could have ultimately resulted in Meta being required to divest of Instagram and WhatsApp. The states <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2022\/01\/14\/state-ags-appeal-dismissal-of-their-antitrust-suit-against-facebook.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">appealed the ruling<\/a> in January 2022, arguing that the district court judge had wrongly terminated their case.<\/p>\n<p>U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg had ruled that states had waited too long to challenge Meta&#8217;s acquisitions and that the policies they had cited were not illegal under antitrust law. The states, however, believed that their unprecedented delay to file &#8220;does not apply against sovereign states suing to protect the public interest, like the states here.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The states also believed the policies could violate antitrust law, so they appealed the case.<\/p>\n<p>The lower court had additionally granted the FTC leave to amend its complaint, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/01\/11\/technology\/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">allowing its case to proceed<\/a>, as was reported last year.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of the states&#8217; case, however, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has now upheld the district court&#8217;s ruling, calling the states&#8217; lawsuit &#8220;not only odd, but old.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The court&#8217;s opinion further explains that the suit &#8220;concerns an industry that, even on the States\u2019 allegations, has had rapid growth and innovation with no end in sight.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It then explains that as &#8220;sovereigns,&#8221; the states aren&#8217;t able to argue for an injunction under antitrust laws, because to be entitled to do so, they must be a &#8220;person, firm, corporation or association,&#8221; which they are not.<\/p>\n<p>The court also agreed with Judge Boasberg&#8217;s, decision that the States &#8220;unduly delayed&#8221; to file their suit. Facebook, (now Meta), had first acquired Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively, but the lawsuit wasn&#8217;t filed until December 2020.<\/p>\n<p>The district court had ruled that the long delays were &#8220;unreasonable and unjustified as a matter of law,&#8221; citing a four-year statute of limitations from other antitrust cases on other circuits as a guideline. The court also pointed out the acquisitions were well-publicized and went through lengthy, publicly reported FTC investigations to determine if they violated antitrust laws at the time.<\/p>\n<p>The appeals court also agreed with Judge Boasberg&#8217;s opinion regarding Facebook&#8217;s Platform and its practices and policies. The States had cited snippets of Facebook policies from 2011 and 2013, which the court said were &#8220;accurate, but the messages they seek to convey are not&#8221; &#8212; meaning, they didn&#8217;t make a case for antitrust law violations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;&#8230;we agree again with Judge Boasberg\u2019s comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion determining that the States\u2019 Platform-based allegations failed to state a cause of action,&#8221; the new opinion issued today states.<\/p>\n<p>It also agreed that the district court was correct that the States\u2019 &#8220;exclusive dealing&#8221; theory fails as a matter of law, as it only limited apps on Facebook but left app developers free to develop applications for Facebook competitors.<\/p>\n<p>On other matters, the lateness of the lawsuit impacted the States&#8217; ability to make its case, as it wanted injunctive relief for a policy that ended in 2018, giving Facebook platform access to companies that have long since shut down or pivoted their business.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Injunctive relief would be unwarranted even if the States could prove their allegations,&#8221; the court noted.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meta has won an antitrust lawsuit, under appeal, that pitted the tech giant against dozens of state attorneys general, led by New York.
