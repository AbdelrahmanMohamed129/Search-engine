family using your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Just install the app and share your location with your friends by choosing from your contacts, entering their email addresses or phone numbers, or using AirDrop.\\n\\nWhen you share your location, your friends can start following your location immediately and easily share their locations back to you so that you’re both in the loop. If at any time you don’t want to be followed, you can hide your location with a single switch.\\n\\nFind My Friends lets you set up location-based alerts that can notify you automatically when a friend arrives at the airport, a child leaves school, or a family member arrives home safely. You can also set up alerts to notify friends about changes in your location.\\n\\nWhen you use Find My Friends, your location can be shared from any of your iOS devices, allowing you to choose the device you have with you most often.
