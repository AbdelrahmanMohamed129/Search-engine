Or have some sight to lend? Be My Eyes is a simple, free tool to see the world better, together.\n\nBe My Eyes connects you with a global community of volunteers and company representatives who are ready at a moment’s notice to help you see – to lend their eyesight and support with everyday tasks.\n\nFREE. GLOBAL. 24/7.\nBe My Eyes is a multi-lingual support community millions strong, available globally day or night, and has volunteers answering calls in more than 185 languages. Join the community today!\n\nSign up to get free visual support with tasks like reading small print, matching clothes, troubleshooting technology, setting up home appliances, or any other simple task a volunteer can complete over live video. If a task is too complicated or requires expertise, call one of our company partners for on-demand video customer support via Specialized Help.\n\nIf you have eyesight you want to share, sign up as a volunteer and answer calls from a person in need! Tasks are usually completed in just a few minutes, and if you’re busy there’s no need to answer – someone else will get it.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. Anyone 17 or older may sign up as a user or volunteer.\n2. Calls are connected based on daytime timezone and language. Average wait time is about 15 seconds.\n3. When a call is answered, a live one-way video (two-way audio) is initiated, allowing volunteers or company reps to see what’s in front of the user’s camera and provide verbal support.\nNote: Specialized Help availability varies by region and company opening hours.\n\nWHAT CAN VOLUNTEERS HELP YOU WITH?\n• Reading home appliances\n• Reading product labels\n• Matching outfits and identifying clothes\n• Help in the kitchen\n• Reading digital displays or computer screens\n• Navigating TV or game menus\n• Operating vending machines or kiosks\n• Sorting music collections or other libraries\n• Picking jewelry or crafts\n\nWHAT CAN YOU DO WITH SPECIALIZED HELP?\n• Web and Computer Technology\n• Health and Beauty Products\n• Banking and Finance\n• Nonprofit Organizations\n• More\n\nWHAT’S NEW:\n• We’ve just reached 3 million volunteers! Thank you for making Be My Eyes the biggest community support micro-volunteering platform ever.\n\nSELECTED AWARDS: \n• 2020 Dubai Expo Global Innovator.\n• 2018 Winner of the Dr. Jacob Bolotin Awards at the NFB National Convention.\n• 2018 Winner of AbilityNet Accessibility Award at the Tech4Good Awards.\n• 2017 Winner of World Summit Awards - Inclusion and Empowerment.","screenshot":["https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/8e/30/f2/8e30f252-73ee-bccf-ac69-2537b078c3df/5efd5cc2-2bb2-4e97-8f52-61c1a8325b1a_iPhone_11_Pro_Max-00_framed.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/1e/64/3e/1e643e7f-2bed-3233-80ef-771e7c025572/77d30db1-f8ad-457c-a035-517258f4e04b_iPhone_11_Pro_Max-01_framed.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0a/cf/7a/0acf7a5f-9b0a-5751-3a05-c45b953991cc/83e079ed-d0a9-4ab9-961d-9f56ba35241a_iPhone_11_Pro_Max-02_framed.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/bd/63/a3/bd63a3b3-321b-e6a9-dfdb-8ee122eaec7b/515eb082-41dc-42df-ba1b-7579e35a9725_iPhone_11_Pro_Max-03_framed.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/5b/7e/99/5b7e9953-05f9-28e2-6634-017c3db6c4e1/9d380339-3a3c-47a5-aba9-e1705e5f38cb_iPhone_11_Pro_Max-04_framed.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/0c/9a/94/0c9a94ad-d589-412b-ab38-b4612cc04613/d0168153-4d18-496b-8394-c7066db911ba_iPhone_11_Pro_Max-05_framed.png/300x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/63/bb/bc/63bbbc2d-7c76-b040-b7df-3585a5136d57/5a40a07a-f5ed-4850-99f6-9c0097206c98_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029-00_framed.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/00/fb/2a/00fb2acc-2d2e-9815-00c4-c85895336945/48d5627e-33be-4ff5-adc0-d3398f8f7745_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029-01_framed.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/60/e6/18/60e618b0-ff0b-94e0-0701-2095a566eb6d/c911cc09-2fea-4b67-92e3-6d81163db2c2_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029-02_framed.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/e1/78/75/e1787566-d3e1-bdf6-9cbc-84a08307435e/4c39acb5-4896-4db3-a5b7-5c7db98c982e_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029-03_framed.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/aa/4e/2a/aa4e2a5c-825e-b091-b2a0-5cf739865098/5f513af7-cbbc-495c-a7ac-cefa0ce808da_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029-04_framed.png/643x0w.jpg","https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple126/v4/88/c4/a3/88c4a3bb-9910-bb51-ec9a-1b87a53be0dc/8a820d07-1f7d-4fc0-807a-8e4b19288037_iPad_Pro__U002812.9-inch_U0029__U00282nd_generation_U0029-05_framed.png/643x0w.jpg"],"image":"https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple116/v4/3b/44/5f/3b445f66-8e5a-c6c9-f5ff-9823d4a30838/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png","applicationCategory":"Lifestyle","datePublished":"Sep 24, 2014","operatingSystem":"Requires iOS 13.6 or later.

Join the community today!<br /><br />Sign up to get free visual support with tasks like reading small print, matching clothes, troubleshooting technology, setting up home appliances, or any other simple task a volunteer can complete over live video.

It connects people who are blind or who have low vision with sighted volunteers who can help with day-to-day tasks. You’ll choose whether you’d like to join the thousands of people receiving assistance or the millions of volunteers providing it. Both parties will select their preferred language(s), and video calls can be initiated with a tap.</p>    <!----></div></div>              </div>                            <div id="ember256472" class="small-valign-top l-column--equal-height l-column small-4 medium-6 large-4">  <div><!----><!----></div>                  <div aria-labelledby="we-customer-review-14895" class="we-customer-review lockup">  <figure class="we-star-rating we-customer-review__rating we-star-rating--large" aria-label="5 out of 5">  <span class="we-star-rating-stars-outlines">    <span class="we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-5"></span>  </span><!----></figure>  <div class="we-customer-review__header we-customer-review__header--user">      <span class="we-truncate we-truncate--single-line  we-customer-review__user" dir="ltr">    devanmarie</span>    <span class="we-customer-review__separator">, </span>    <time data-test-customer-review-date datetime="2018-09-19T14:26:01.000Z" aria-label="September 19, 2018" class="we-customer-review__date" >09/19/2018</time>  </div>    <h3 class="we-truncate we-truncate--single-line  we-customer-review__title" dir="ltr" id="we-customer-review-14895">    I am a volunteer and it brightens up my day!</h3>      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>                <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love answering calls because it humbles me that low vision or blind people go through a lot of extra work just to get through daily life. And to be able to make it easier for them means the world to me. It ALWAYS makes me smile even if I’m having a bad day by helping. Everyone is so grateful and wonderful to work with. I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world. I can’t want until my next call to help out someone new. Now if I could also meet them, that would just mean the world to me to meet these incredible people. They inspire me.</p>    <!----></blockquote><!----></div>              </div>                            <div id="ember256474" class="small-valign-top l-column--equal-height l-column small-4 medium-6 large-4">  <div><!----><!----></div>                  <div aria-labelledby="we-customer-review-14896" class="we-customer-review lockup">  <figure class="we-star-rating we-customer-review__rating we-star-rating--large" aria-label="5 out of 5">  <span class="we-star-rating-stars-outlines">    <span class="we-star-rating-stars we-star-rating-stars-5"></span>  </span><!----></figure>  <div class="we-customer-review__header we-customer-review__header--user">      <span class="we-truncate we-truncate--single-line  we-customer-review__user" dir="ltr">    austinnray</span>    <span class="we-customer-review__separator">, </span>    <time data-test-customer-review-date datetime="2019-12-16T19:10:38.000Z" aria-label="December 16, 2019" class="we-customer-review__date" >12/16/2019</time>  </div>    <h3 class="we-truncate we-truncate--single-line  we-customer-review__title" dir="ltr" id="we-customer-review-14896">    Wonderful Concept</h3>      <blockquote class="we-truncate we-truncate--multi-line we-truncate--interactive  we-customer-review__body" dir>                <p dir="false" data-test-bidi>I love having this app on my phone. While I have only received two calls in the last 6 months (I was too late to answer my first call, but successfully answered the second call today!), it’s still amazing that I was able to help someone with something so small; something the rest of us take for granted every day. <br /><br />Today a woman called asking if I could help her adjust her thermostat. When she pointed the camera, it was a little low. I asked her to hold the phone up a little, and then I was able to see the thermostat clearly. Her heat was set on 70°, so she counted the buttons up to 75° and I let her know she had successfully turned her heat up. She said she didn’t need anymore help and thanked me for helping! I told her she was welcome and to have a great day. She was very sweet and I was glad I got to help:) <br /><br />A lot of these reviews seem to forget this app is for the visually impaired. It isn’t about how many calls you get to answer, or how great you feel because you volunteered. This app is designed to help those who need it. I think it’s wonderful that so many people volunteer, regardless of the number of people that need help.</p>    <!----></blockquote><!----></div>              </div>                </div>        <div class="l-row l-row--margin-top medium-hide">              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->              <!---->                  </div>    </section><!----><!----><!---->  <section class="l-content-width section section--bordered app-privacy">  <div class="section__nav">    <h2 class="section__headline section__headline--app-privacy">      App Privacy    </h2>    <div class="app-privacy--modal privacy-type--modal"><!----><!----></div>  </div>  <p>    The developer, <span class="app-privacy__developer-name">Be My Eyes</span>, indicated that the app’s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

I even helped out a man with narrowed vision who voluntarily goes out and helps homeless people and needed help reading a SUPER small print sheet that had all the resources for people in need. He just needed to find the one for housing to help people get back on their feet. Not only are they giving back and volunteering, but I felt a part of it at the same time because I was able to help him find the resources he needed so he could give out to those he helps who are homeless. Someone with a disability giving back in the way they receive help themselves is the definition of giving forward. And I just think this is Suh an amazing app, with amazing people all over the world.

When she pointed the camera, it was a little low. I asked her to hold the phone up a little, and then I was able to see the thermostat clearly. Her heat was set on 70°, so she counted the buttons up to 75° and I let her know she had successfully turned her heat up. She said she didn’t need anymore help and thanked me for helping! I told her she was welcome and to have a great day. She was very sweet and I was glad I got to help:) \\n\\nA lot of these reviews seem to forget this app is for the visually impaired. It isn’t about how many calls you get to answer, or how great you feel because you volunteered. This app is designed to help those who need it.

You answer a special ring tone if you have time (usually about 10 mins or so) if not someone else probably can get it.  I always try to make time when I can.  The callers need help with rather simple tasks and they know what they need but not being able to see is their only obstacle.  With CoVid 19 isolating low sighted and blind persons from their normal support group of sighted friends and family has left them in a lurch.  Once it was helping a lady find the right bills to pay for grocery delivery,  once helping a lady read her prescription number to a pharmacist over the phone, helping someone who needed to match an outfit for a job interview (not used to wearing business clothes) and helping with computer issues.  Nothing has been too hard or too time consuming and the feeling of being able to help someone pick the right train track can be a godsend to the person on the other end.

I’ve had maybe 5 calls in 2 years but only able to answer one of them fast enough and it was a person paying for a taxi verifying the correct payment amount.  You probably will only get a few calls and maybe be lucky enough to answer one or two because there’s WAY more volunteers than users but it seems like a great service for those with visual impairments.  If you have an iPhone you need to make sure it doesn’t offload the app to the cloud because you may only get a call like every few months so if you don’t use it iPhone will offload it to the cloud and you won’t get notifications when you have a call.  This is probably a comment for another forum but in general “Apple? needs to make an iOS fix to allow the user to designate certain apps (any app) to not ever go to the cloud due to inactivity.  Seems like this is kind of an obvious missing feature from the iPhone settings “Apple?… why don’t you go ahead and fix that for all of us mmmkay?\",\"rating\":5,\"isEdited\":false,\"userName\":\"fergusoninc\",\"title\":\"Neat service - I’m glad it’s out there\"}},{\"id\":\"9149075990\",\"type\":\"user-reviews\",\"attributes\":{\"date\":\"2022-10-04T04:00:06Z\",\"review\":\"I love this app so much I love helping others and volunteering in my community.

I was staying at a hotel. At the breakfast room I called for my eyes because I needed to know with the various food items, napkins, plates, cups, and everything else work. the volunteer who answered was excellent. He showed me where the coffee machine and cups were, showed me how to use the machine, and then told me about all the other items that were around. He showed me where the cereal was the milk, the eggs the sausage, the muffins, the bread, the napkins, the plates and silverware were. He was extremely helpful. Because of him, I know where everything was for the week I spent in that place. The second time I called a volunteer while there, I asked her if she could show me how to use the treadmill. She gave me excellent instructions. I did not need cited help from anyone in the hotel. Thanks to these two wonderful volunteers! be my eyes is an excellent app, and it has made my life so much easier.

Well, I always try to answer, but I have to unlock my phone first. By the time I get it unlocked, the call has been passed to someone else. If I have more than a few seconds to answer, I would be able to answer more often. It would be great if the request came through as a FaceTime call; I think I don’t have to unlock my phone for that. Furthermore, I would be more useful if I could set my app to available or unavailable when I’m sitting idle or driving. Because of the issues I have answering and the rarity of requests, I have often considered deleting the app altogether. \\n Other than my two complaints, I have enjoyed the app. I really enjoyed helping the two folks I was able to assist. I’ll be honest, I get really excited when the opportunity to help someone arises. Helping others is what I enjoy most in life, but I would like more opportunities to do so.

I did it the first second I learned of it. I jumped at the chance to answer a call every time I saw my phone ringing, but I was never quite quick enough! Which goes to show you how many great Americans are out there who want to help just as much as I do! Finally though it happened... My phone rang and I clicked to answer and I actually started to be connected with the caller! She wanted something as simple as me telling her which bag of candy was which because she had about 5 bags of miniature candy. That was it. The overwhelming joy that my heart felt to be able to help someone who’s incapable of doing such small tasks such as that, overjoys  me. After the call I just was stuck sitting there for a moment with a smile on my face, and almost sad that I couldn’t help her with more.

There is many people who are willing to answer the call whenever you need help. I just have one wish that the assistant could have settings where we can make our calls louder and call whenever we want not just where we live, instead of the original of what comes with the app. I am half deaf so I can barely hear when someone calls, but I have my volume up the highest it can go, and I have my settings on the loudest it can do on my part on my phone. I wish the app would fix or put in settings where you can choose a louder sound for calls. I would love to help more people if the app can put better features that can happen so I can get to my phone faster. Lol I just love helping people!

I was honestly just so happy to have finally received a call and I hope that I was thorough in helping her. She was so sweet and fun to talk to as well, which is just an added bonus!\\n\\nI wish I had remembered the ‘screen shot’ feature sooner in the call (ahh!) because it is a total game changer. Hopefully I have a second call now that I’m familiar with the platform.\\n\\nSo, New volunteers, here are a few tips if you’re feeling unsure:\\n-  dont forget the ‘screenshot’, ‘torch’ and being able to background the app (useful to look something up via the browser on your phone during the call if needed) \\n- Make sure that after you both complete the task(s) at hand, you ask again if they need help with anything else (possibly a continuation of what the call was about i.e. I wish I would have asked if she needed help with actually preparing the food item after I read her the heating instructions for it, without overstepping).    \\n\\nThe interface of Be My Eyes is next level, top notch, A grade…and that’s an understatement.\\n\\nIn closing, this short interaction did just as much for me (if not more) than it did for her.

Done!\\nWe’ll pick up your laundry, wash it, dry it, fold it, and return it to you the next day (for orders in by 3pm).\\n\\nYou hate laundry, but we love it. We’re obsessed with laundry, care to every detail, and deliver nothing but perfection—clean, fresh, and folded to a T. In fact, we ask afterward “Was it perfect?? Customer ratings mean that only the best washers stay in the network.\\n\\nSudshare is a customized and personalized service. Machine dry, hang dry, hypoallergenic…it’s up to you. It’s your laundry done your way. Just let us know in the ordering process.\\n\\nSudshare makes life easy and simple. No worries no work. You give us your laundry, we give you more time.\\n\\nFAQ’S\\n\\n- Do I have to put my clothes out for pickup in laundry bags?\\nNo. You can put your clothes out for pickup in any bag you want—just make sure it’s closed at the top. Most people use disposable bags. If you have air-dry/gentle-wash clothes, put them in a separate bag and inside put a note that says “air-dry?.\\n\\n- What if I want certain items returned on a hanger instead of folded?\\nNo problem. Simply put the correct number of hangers in your air-dry bag. If it’s obvious which items get hung, you’re done. If it’s not obvious, include a note in “Special Instructions? when you order.\\n\\n- Do I have to separate lights and darks?\\nWhy would you? That’s our job. Your job is to click and order. We take care of everything else.\\n\\n- Do I have to be home for pickups and deliveries?\\nNo! We’re all about convenience. Just put your clothes out after you order and go on with your day. We’ll pick up your clothes, wash, dry, fold, and deliver them clean and fresh next day (you’ll get updates on your order throughout the process).\\n\\n- Can I request a hypoallergenic detergent?\\nAbsolutely! Just choose “hypoallergenic? when you order. There’s no extra charge.\\n\\n- Who are the Sudsters? Who will be washing my clothes?\\nAs part of the sharing economy, SudShare allows people to turn their washer/dryer into an income-producing asset that saves you from doing laundry. So SudShare washers (we call them Sudsters) are independent contractors who use the SudShare platform. In order to use the platform, Sudsters are first vetted by SudShare. We do an identity check, train each washer in laundry best practices, and educate them about customer expectations. In addition, all Sudsters are rated after the completion of every job, and the reputation system in the platform results in poor Sudsters getting purged from the system and the best Sudsters getting the most work. Keep in mind also that in the event a garment is lost or damaged, you’re protected by our Garment Protection Plan.\\n\\n- What time do you pick up and deliver?\\nPickup and delivery occurs between 8am-8pm. After your order is accepted you’ll get a message with an approximate pickup time, usually within a couple hours of ordering. But you don’t need to be home. Just put your bags out and go on with your day. In addition, you get updates on where your clothes are in the process and when they’re delivered.\\n\\n- Do you do dry cleaning?\\nNo.\\n\\n- What if clothes are lost?\\nIt’s extremely rare, but in the event a garment is lost or damaged, you’re protected by our Garment Protection Plan.\\n\\nServicing over 300+ cities nationwide - Go to SudShare.com/locations to confirm we service your zip code.\\n\\nWebsite: https://sudshare.com/\"},\"isStandaloneWithCompanionForWatchOS\":false,\"isAppleWatchSupported\":false,\"versionHistory\":[{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.19.5\",\"releaseNotes\":\"Support widget improvements\\nGeneral bug fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-04-25\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-04-25T20:06:46Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.18.0\",\"releaseNotes\":\"Support and Help Center improvements\\n\\nGeneral bug fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-04-10\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-04-10T15:04:13Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.17.0\",\"releaseNotes\":\"Support and Help Center improvements\\nGeneral bug fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-03-21\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-03-21T16:31:41Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.16.1\",\"releaseNotes\":\"- Improvements to the stability of the application\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-03-08\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-03-08T21:08:42Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.16.0\",\"releaseNotes\":\"-General bug fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-03-06\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-03-06T10:21:30Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.15.1\",\"releaseNotes\":\"- Critical fix for rating and tipping screen\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-02-22\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-02-22T00:19:36Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.15.0\",\"releaseNotes\":\"Fixed bug that caused incorrect timestamps in messages with Sudsters\\nFixed bug that prevented customers from rating and tipping on orders placed on older app\\n\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-02-13\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-02-13T20:05:01Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.14.2\",\"releaseNotes\":\"- Bugfixes\\n- Improvements to place order\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-02-03\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-02-03T00:25:44Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.14.1\",\"releaseNotes\":\"- Bug fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-01-31\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-01-31T19:42:12Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.14.0\",\"releaseNotes\":\"New Features!\\n- Create Profiles\\n- Place Multiple Orders\\n- Stability and Performance Fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-01-30\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-01-30T14:26:39Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.13.5\",\"releaseNotes\":\"-Improved customer support tool\\n-Ability to leave larger tips on orders\\n-Other bug fixes\",\"releaseDate\":\"2023-01-23\",\"releaseTimestamp\":\"2023-01-23T21:36:13Z\"},{\"versionDisplay\":\"3.13.0\",\"releaseNotes\":\"We update the SudShare app as often as possible to make it easier and more reliable for you.
