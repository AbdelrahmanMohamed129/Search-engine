This series will chart some of the big unanswered questions about the our nearest neighbour in the solar system, how space agencies around the world intend to go back there, and most of all why returning to the Moon really does matter.

One day, she found that the children were enthusiastically playing with breadcrumbs that had dropped on the floor, says Catherine L'Ecuyer, a researcher in psychology and education at the University of Navarra in Spain and author of The Wonder Approach. \"It then occurred to her that the origin of some intellectual disabilities could be related with impoverishment.\" With the right learning materials, these and other young minds could be nurtured, Montessori concluded.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe observation would lead Montessori to develop a new method of education that focused on providing the optimum stimulation during the sensitive periods of childhood.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt its centre was the principle that all the learning materials should be child-sized and designed to appeal to all the senses.

If those who received the intervention did better those who did not, you can conclude that it has worked as desired.

For example, we might assume that such objects were finished creations, and contain symbolic information. Instead, it can be helpful to focus on how they were actually engaging with materials, and talk about \"aesthetics\". What Neanderthals' engravings and pigments have in common is an intention to alter how surfaces were perceived, whether visually or in a tactile way. The Krapina talons, for example, have \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Flink.springer.com\u002Fcontent\u002Fpdf\u002F10.1038\u002Fs41598-020-62938-4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Etiny areas of polish\u003C\u002Fa\u003E, as if they rubbed up against other hard materials, perhaps each other.

Discoveries at the site go back to 1987, when a teenager keen on caving found a tiny cavity from which a breeze was coming, as if the hill was exhaling. After three years of patient digging and crawling, one day he broke through into a system of large chambers, some with beautiful shallow pools. One of which, some 300m (984ft) in, contained a truly remarkable construction. What had seemed initially to be some kind of dam made of fallen stalagmites turned out to be a structure made up of snapped off pieces, obviously human-made, but by people who'd left no traces except a few burnt pieces of bone. In the mid-1990s radiocarbon dating pointed to a remarkably ancient age, beyond the technique's then-limit of 45,000 years. It was only after dating of calcite deposits over the stalagmites using a different method that measures the ratios of uranium and thorium in the rock, reported in 2016 that the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.nature.com\u002Farticles\u002Fnature18291\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Etrue antiquity of the rings became apparent &ndash; 174,000-176,000 years\u003C\u002Fa\u003E old.

Third, the layer the skulls and hearths were in built up over a considerable time, covering some 2m (6.6ft) in depth, which would require a very long-term ritualised use of the space. And finally, an \"ordinary\" explanation does exist: cut-marks and smashing shows that the brains, eyes and tongues were being removed for food. It seems that hunted animals were initially being butchered elsewhere, potentially just outside the cave, and then the skulls along with some other bones were brought inside to be further processed by hearths. Once the juicy bits within the skulls were obtained, there was no reason to further smash them up, and perhaps the blocky, cobble nature of the layer meant that they survived in more complete form than typical.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut why would the Neanderthals bother to carry these heavy skulls inside?

As we can&rsquo;t predict exactly how many readers will click on the story before we publish it, we use a per-pageview emissions estimate, which is the same for all stories. We got this figure using a test story, calculating emissions as above and then dividing that by the pageviews that the test story actually had over six months. That gives us a better estimate than just plugging in the URL from a story to the agency&rsquo;s standard carbon calculator, because for a story where the number of pageviews is a weighty factor in the equation, using data on actual pageviews makes it more accurate.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe story we used as a test to get this figure was a BBC Future story, and we used the actual number of pageviews it had over a six-month period.

If we do, should we count the carbon emissions from the large number of energy-hungry servers housed in the building, or is that irrelevant as they don&rsquo;t host Future Planet?
